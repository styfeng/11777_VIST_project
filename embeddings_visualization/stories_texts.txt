our landmark tree in town was about to be destroyed and cleared for a new mall .
so we decided to take the day to go out and enjoy its beauty .
to see the final glimpse of the roots , extending out into the depths of the hill .
and its magnificent trunk , larger than life itself .
one last picture of its beauty so we could capture it forever .
we found this tree when we were walking in a nearby town .
it turns out it is a popular attraction here .
the tree is very unusual , with its roots exposed .
the trunk was really wide , as much as 12 feet !
you can see how big these roots are - pretty amazing !
pictures of a tree are taken .
the top of the tree is taken .
another part of the tree mostly the roots .
some more different parts of the tree .
and some more parts of the tree is taking .
they went to the botanic gardens specifically to see the large tree .
there was an informational sign posted near it .
the roots were huge and spread out over the ground .
the trunk was incredibly thick and rigid .
the large roots were almost as thick as the trunk .
we went to see the largest tree in the country .
the plack under it had some interesting information .
there was a good view of the water from the tree as well .
i was dwarfed by the tree 's size .
in the end we went over to the visitor center .
our trip to location last year was filled with beauty . sculptures could be found everywhere we went .
the architecture was old and interesting .
since it was spring , beautiful flowers lined the streets . this pink bloom was particularly lovely .
we went to a museum and saw this odd collection of hanging faces !
i 'd have to say my favorite part of the trip would have to be the food though . we ca n't wait to go back again !
the monuments in the city were wonderful .
others made you think a little bit .
the architecture was also great .
the statues were so well made and defined .
after a long day of admiration , we wrapped it up with delicious food .
i went on vacation this past year .
i saw some really cool buildings .
there were some flowers unique to the area too .
i also went to a museum where there was this creepy head floating exhibit .
afterwards i had some great food before i headed home !
the family visited location for the summer .
we visited a museum with many floors of art .
before we entered the museum , we noticed the beautiful flowers in a garden .
inside the museum , porcelain heads hanged from the ceiling .
after visiting the musuem , the family decided to eat a restaurant nearby . i ordered mashed potatoes with vegetables and beef wellington .
a large monument in the center of town .
a statue that is in park .
very old church in the beautiful town square .
a statue that is standing tall .
dinner after a day of sightseeing .
[male] and i were excited to be in location location during the 4th of july .
there was a huge crowd of people already awaiting the firework show .
we were lucky to find a nice spot on the grass to watch the show .
as the evening grew darker the crowd was gearing up to enjoy the show , with a great view of the location location .
i was able to capture a great photo of the grand finale of the firework show .
the two friends went to a new location
they arrived at the festival and was surprised to see alot of people
the festival went off without a hitch
after it was over that evening people stayed to see a show
the show went off without a hitch and the fireworks were beautiful
i met up with a friend in location .
we had lunch and then visited the [male] [male] statue .
after visiting the organization statue , we sat on some grass at a park .
a few other people began to show up to the park . many of them mentioned a fireworks show .
my friend and i stayed around for the fireworks show .
my two best friends [male] and [male] came to event today !
there was a huge turnout for presidents day ! [male] and [male] were so excited .
we had our own little spot on the grass .
soon it got dark and [female] arrived in her cute flower dress .
fireworks ! yay ! we sat back and had a good old time .
always great to visit our nation 's capital .
large crowds had gathered on the steps of the location location
relaxing and enjoying the well manicured national mall
as the sky darkened , it was almost time for the show .
the fireworks were the best that we had ever seen
the city in 1940 decided to build a water dam .
over 100 's of construction trucks .
the city dam was used to generate power to the city .
the construction workers began leveling the ground for the water dam .
water pumps were used to control the water flow of the dam .
the construction workers were at work .
the crane was lifting something up
it was a large rock .
the crane went back to work .
there were a lot of cranes at the work site .
it was a simpler time indeed
the men worked long hours to provide modern marvels we love today
lots of men were killed and the family 's were devastated
the men weeped as they buried their brothers
and he finally built the very first washing machine
we took the old wooden bridge to get to the job site to start our day .
we fired up the machinery and got to work .
we were building a new waterway for the reservoir to spill into .
it was a long hot day , but we stayed busy .
finally , we added some chemicals to the new water filtration system .
in the old days , it was difficult building bridges .
the crane proves to be the most reliable device for these jobs .
however , moving equipment and supplies proved to be a difficult task .
sometimes jobs went incomplete due to the lack of supplies .
this job does n't look like it will finish .
my father visited location for the summer .
he visited a small temple .
he encountered many great people on his visit .
a few of the individuals he took pictures of were camera shy .
inside the temple you could see the beautiful hand carved and painted murals .
heritage and history are important things to the world .
it 's nice to be able to look back and see how things are , how they were , and how they 've changed to get here .
so much of what people believe shapes the future .
every generation leaves their mark , and we look for the youth to decide what their 's is going to be .
everyone has a chance to change things for the better .
i took a trip to location .
i visited with a lot of children from an orphanage .
i also learned a lot about jewish tradition .
the kids were all very sweet .
i became very close to those at the orphanage .
i had the opportunity to travel with a photographer friend of mine to location . i brought my camera to take photos too !
we visited many places , some so beautiful in very subtle ways .
my friend introduced me to his group of friends , who were also photographers .
afterwards , we met a nice woman who explained that she was much too shy to have her photo taken .
so i decided to practice my craft on a wall mural instead !
my buddy rich and i took photos of the locals in the country .
they had beautiful places of worship unlike anything we 've seen in location .
our photography team was huge because we had a lot of places to cover .
unfortunately some people did n't want their photo taken .
the last image i took before running out of memory was this beautiful mosaic . i was floored on the deftness of artistry by these people .
the couple took a picture .
his wife was pregnant .
they took a silly picture .
they later went on a hike .
they got a picture of her behind a mountain .

our friends encouraged us to participate . the family was not easily amused .
the city put on an event for us to come out and participate .
we cooked with old utensils and very few ingredients .

some are raised to believe that the world takes all kinds of people to make it go 'round .
our group of friends certainly demonstrates that adage to be true .
there are always interesting moments to be found for those hanging around any of us .
moments that you are n't quite sure what is going on , and are n't really sure you want to know either .
but everything is always in good fun , and we enjoy hanging out .
we were walking down the street and were stopped by a homeless man .
he was offering sexual favors for money but he had herpes all over his lips .
my girl showed him how he should be advertising .
this pop bottle exploded at just the right time .
i was in shock watching it all .

spreading enjoyment to all who view the colorful creations .
the marvelous light shows are hard not to love , and are looked forward to year after year .
the fireworks were a gem this year .
the yellow bursts seemed closer than they were .
they expanded my view of the sky .
it seemed much brighter up there ,
in the dark night sky .
the beginning of the fireworks was n't so bright .
this one looked like a jellyfish to everyone
we all thought this one looked like a ferris wheel stuck on fast .
the colors were great for some .
the reds ones were the best .
the fireworks begin to go off .
the crowds ooh and ahh around .
everyone is impressed by the display .
now it is the grand finale
look at all of those fireworks !
i always enjoy paying a visit to organization organization .
seeing the control panel on some of the old equipment can be fascinating .
i am always very tempted to turn one of the dials to see what it will do .
some of the equipment is so tall that it can almost touch the ceiling .
after my visit , i was treated to an evening fireworks display .
our skies have long held mysteries for us , and fascinated us with their possibilities .
we construct places to observe and record what information we find .
and search for whatever might be lurking out there in the depths of space .
we are n't able to actually venture out beyond our satellite yet , but in the meantime our own skies can be alluring .
we 'll celebrate in the hope of one day finding more out there , and to enjoy what we have now .
today i went to organization organization .
i saw old spitz stuff that looked ancient . like this defibrayakmalater . it was so weird ! i wandered over to this odd knob .
it was a hydracodolene radio knob . it could shock the hair right off your body !
next i saw a spackumpeepoopadic ! it could beam you into space ! ! i did n't attempt to use it out of fear . it came on though so i ran out of there !
where did the day go ! after running out of the building i ran straight into the view of awesome fireworks ! !
old controls of lab equipment in the museum
a larger shot of the lab equipment
some knob that i have no idea what it was used for
some more lab equipment
fireworks at the end of the day
we went to look at things in a museum .
we saw old control panels .
look at this old knob !
there were even satellites at the museum .
then we saw fireworks .
our new puppy is the sweetest thing ever .
he 's already chewing on everything so we 're planning on getting him some toys .

sometimes he gets up though to play . he loves this empty water bottle .
it does n't take him long though to tire himself out and pass out . i hope he stays this small forever !
this is our new puppy , [female] !
he 's a playful little guy and likes to chew .
i tried giving him an empty soda pop bottle , and he really enjoyed it !
when he 's not running about , he 's usually sleeping .
i just ca n't get enough of his cute face !
when we took little [female] home she was initially pretty nervous .
she thought her water bowl was a chew toy at first .
all that chewing tuckered her out pretty quickly .
when [female] woke up , she found a new thing to chew on -- caught in the act !
welcome to our home , [female] -- take a nap !
the dog is being held up , and loved .

how can anyone ever pick a favorite firework display .
the every changing nature of the different explosions of light are part of the allure .
seeing violet flowers bloom in the night sky .
only to see them replaced by rainbows of fire dancing before your eyes .

the whole group gathers for a bike ride .
some do tricks to pass the time as they wait for others to arrive .
some , dressed more freely , chose to use the time to ensure they have everything .
the ride lasts long into the evening for many .
however , some beg off early and just relax and have fun .
a couple of friends gathered to take a bicycle race around the city .

tuning up the bike for our night ride .
night rides are always a lot of fun .
the end of the ride , but not the end of the night !
bike rallies are fun and this one was no exception .
although doing tricks half naked on concrete is really not such a good idea .
and i am still trying to figure out why [male] was wearing red fishnet hose and a helmet .
the cycling lasted well into the night .
and at that point , all the exercise conscious participants drank a lot of beer and acted like idiots .

my last stop was at the beauty shop for a day of much need beauty .
i went home to surprise my husband with my new makeover .

unusual costumes are expected to drive interest .
i really did n't know what to expect when i decided to go to an expo on drugs and drug awareness last week . the man who was greeting people at the door was covered in an alka seltzer shirt .
while some of the exhibits were focused on drug awareness , like guessing how many different pills were in a bottle , some exhibits seemed to promote drug use . not sure what to think .
i politely declined trying out this display .
there were a couple of tattoo artists who were offering tattoos at a discount . can you imagine having a permanent spider web on your head ? this guy 's getting ready for halloween apparently .
i thought it was really appropriate to have this display about different types of infections and what causes them right in the center of the tattoo area .
take a guess at the amount of `` drug paraphernalia '' at this years halloween bash !
and do n't be afraid , hes the friendly clown in town !
why not give the dunk tank a try ?
as if there was n't enough fun already , take a huff and see how well you know your stuff !
who needs alka seltzer when you have billa seltzer ? but be sure not to spill the sprite on this mans creative costume !
getting the tables ready for the carnival !
[male] the clown practicing his act with us .
[female] being a brave sole testing out the dunk tank .

there were such vibrant colors in some of them .
the detail was amazing in a few of them .
the ones that looked like giant sparklers were my favorite .
it ended with a great finally
fireworks are beautiful on their own .
messing with the settings on your camera can give them new brilliance and mystery .
spirals of light dancing across the blackness .
or streamers of multi-colored firing falling down .
camera options can turn a firework into a winter event with these pale stars falling down .
my family and i went to a fireworks show . the first set of fireworks were very bright and flashy !

a couple of friends dressed up in fourth of july costumes walk down to the harbor to celebrate the day .
a boat can be seen in the distance , along with a small flying object .
the sun sets as a boat prepares for the fireworks show .
right before all of the light drains from the sky , the first fireworks can be seen .
now it is nighttime and the beautiful display shines brightly in the sky for all to enjoy .
the scene was set when they went to the harbor
these two men took a stroll and one of them thought he was going to have the best day ever
the man made him look up to the sky and he say one letter that was in his name and his heart beat faster
he thought he was going to propose but it was just a failed heart
his disappointment continued when their baloons got stuck in a tree
josh and i wore our 4th of july gear and headed to the pier .

we visited my wife 's family for the summer .
her parents live in location .
they have a big house with many acres of land .
the house was built in 1995 .
i was fascinated by the lake that is near the home .
as we traveled to the lake house it looked like a storm was brewing .
we saw the bent tree that marked our driveway .
then the house slowly came into view across the field .
the house that my father built .
the clouds finally cleared and we took an evening stroll along the shore .
my friends and i are photographers . we caught this beautiful scene last night .
we enjoy taking pictures of the beautiful outdoors . the hanging tree captivated us , so we just had to picture it !
we found a house while looking for things to take pictures of . i wonder who lives there ?
it 's a very pretty house . whoever lives there must be filthy freakin ' rich .
and they live by a beautiful lake ! i 'm downright jealous . oh well ... a picture will do !
when the flood hit the city some years back , my grandad 's house remained intact .
i remember waves of water rolling through the field , i thought we would get flooded .
but because his house stood tall , it remained in place .
the water rose up to my neck , if the house was built any lower than we would not have a house .
now the water remains calm where it should .
we just bought this house out in the middle of nowhere and it is great !
the surrounding area is beautiful , but a little swampy .
the house sets back and the braces underneath keep it safe from flooding .
though it does make getting to the house a chore at times .
but looking around at where it is , i would n't trade it for anything .
we had so much fun being tourists while looking at colleges .
the statues were awe inspiring .
we stopped for lunch at a great restaurant with a beautiful patio .
we visited some of the old cemeteries to see all the history .
the view from our hotel room at the end of the night was amazing .

taking pictures of fireworks can be really tricky . this is my favorite .
you have to get the settings right on your camera to catch all the light and have it not blur .
here you can see some of the smoke from the explosion .
this is one i 'll probably toss . it just sort of fizzles on the ground .
if you leave the lens open extra long you can get all the trailing light in the shot , too .

grandpa took my daughter to location for the fourth of july .
he loves my little girls as much as he loves me .
he took to the awesome parades .
then they went to the see the fireworks .
the best part is always the last when they throw all the fireworks into the air at the same time .
my grand daughter and i decided we needed some time to our self so we decided to go to the fireworks together by ourselves .

some people were content to drink .
others thought we all wanted to see their butts .
we watched the fireworks from our porch , in comfort .
today we decided to have a party at my house .
my boyfriend grilled the food for us . so glad he did n't burn it !
here 's my boyfriends best friend . he 's annoying , but i love him .
i think he 's had too much to drink . i hope he does n't puke on my carpet .
we then all went outside to watch the fireworks . it was a good party .
[male] and his aa cohort are having a 4th of july party .
all the drinking made them hungry , so they decided to do some grilling .
after dinner , [male] is contemplative on the balcony .
he goes to use the restroom , but it 's occupied . oh well !
[male] and friends are ready for the sun to go down and the fireworks to go up !
i went with my girlfriend to see the fireworks on the fourth of july .
the crowd was thin before the sun went down .
after the sun went down more people started to show up .
the fireworks were awesome .
i especially like it when they set several off at the same time .
huge crowds showed up for the annual fireworks display .
kids every where were playing with sparklers , laughing with excitement .
sadly , some people apparently did n't know how to behave in public .
we watched the event from the bridge .
the display was beautiful and i 'll be back to watch again next year .
people gathered downtown after dark to watch fireworks .
a lady plays with a sparkler just before the sun goes down .
a wall with graffiti on it is the resting place for one man .
the aerial view of the city shows all of the lights .
the firework show begins with bright blue explosions .
everybody was getting their cameras ready to shoot pictures of fireworks .
the fireworks were shot over the water so some people sat on their balconies .
everybody else found a place near the water to watch the show .
the fireworks shined so bright over the water .
even the ones that were just plain white shined so beautifully . it was a nice night .
my friends and i went out to see fireworks on july 4th .
we picked the perfect spot to sit at .
a lot of people came .
the fireworks looked so beautiful .

[male] [male] took us to the vegan festival .
it was filled with a ton of people preaching about who veganism had changed their lives .
they had plant exhibitions .
also , animals to entertain the children while the adults preached .
we left right after the speeches ended .
the streets were packed for the free concert .
everyone gathered to see the band .
around the corner you could see some cool cacti growing .
i even spotted a cute sea turtle .
this little girl was just playing in the water fountain .
i thoroughly enjoy these types of events . we have an opportunity to meet many different types of people .
the turn out was enormous . there are so many people here . i hope i do n't get lost .
look at how beautiful the beach is . i think it was a great idea to have the event here .
here are a couple of my friends , taking in the fresh air , and admiring the beautiful sights and sounds .
at the end of the event , there were fireworks . fireworks are always a great way to end any event .
the crowd awaits for the new attraction to open , taking pictures of the entrance .
people from surrounding cities await for the grand opening .
as you enter the park it has different areas for you to explore .
boats take you on the rivers to see the wild life .
at dark the park puts on a fire works display that is full on color and noise .
this is my grandpa , he needs a bra .
but i find it awfully funny when he runs or jumps !
oh ! daddy says it 's time to eat ! the sooner i have dinner the sooner i can go see the awesome fireworks !
i ate all my dinner , daddy is so proud of me ! oi , i really hope he does n't toss me up again , something might come out .
daddy was right ! there are fireworks , this is awesome , i 'm going to make sure to eat my dinner every night
grandpa was happy to have the family over for the 4th .
his granddaughter also came for a visit .
they were so happy to see each other . they played for a long time .
grandpa took her to see some fireworks .
she was scared of the loud boom , but excited by the bright colors . it was a perfect day .
it was fourth of july weekend , and the family was getting together for a good time .
the kids were all here , and little [female] was particularly excited about fireworks later .
daddy played with [female] as they waited for nightfall .

[male] grew his organization organization beard in the wrong season .
[female] was having a lot of fun this evening .
though she had to eat her dinner before having more fun .
[male] lifted her up in the air several times .
then fireworks exploded outside because it was independence day .
[male] had fun on his last day of summer .
they got to spend a lot of time in the pool playing games .
[male] 's baby brother wanted to play to but he was n't ready he did n't have any swimmys on .
time to lay back on the floats and relax a bit .
kick those legs little buddy , his dad told him .
my family had a great time over the 4th of july . first we went to the pool .
then we had a snack on the back porch . i had cheese crackers and pretzels , my favorite !
my dad , brother , and i decided to have a beanbag tournament .
i was losing , so i tried a new tactic ! it did n't work !
after dark , we played with sparklers and fireworks . it was a great 4th !
the kid is very happy while drinking his juice and eating his crackers .
the boy and man is swimming and stops and look over the pool .
the baby is happy and smiling while sitting next to the pool .
the boy is in his floater , floating in the water .
the man plays with the boy while he in his floater .
having fun in the pool .
eating chips and drinking juice .
teaching him how to juggle .
catching sacks .
celebrating the 4th of july .
my child is a real handful on the weekends .
the easiest way to tame him is to take him to the pool .
he can literally swim for eight hours and not tire of it .
maybe it 's because of all the pool games that the community center has to offer .
or maybe it 's because his brother is always right there to play with him .
we hung out in the park and listened to the street musicians .
my wife got some reading done while we were there .
we rested in the warm sunny weather .
a lot of people were lounging at the park .
once night fell it was time to follow the neon for a drink .
there are so many things to do in the park . you can play a game of chess .
you can play your guitar , or stop to listen to someone play their guitar .
you can sit on a bench and read a good book .
you ban do a little sun bathing .
or best of all , you can just snuggle and enjoy the day with your loved one .
i love a relaxing day in the park . i like to start with a nice quiet game of chess with one of the masters who frequent this place .
i then like to hang out in the musical corner of the park where there is always a great artist playing for free . there 's some real talent here .
on a nice warm day i like to find a quiet bench and pull out a book for some reading time . today is one of those days .
wait , who is this guy just staring at me . what are you looking at fella ?
oh crap , i think i pissed him off . this day is turning out to be less peaceful than i imagined !
time for a fun day in the park , first a game of chess .
then listen to a street musician play on his guitar .
i like to sit and read for a few in the sun .
my buddy likes to relax and not read .
this is what my buddy did to me for reading .
walking through the park we catch a free show from this local guitar player .
taking a rest on the bench for a quick minute .
sitting in the shade , these two take a break from the hot sun .
a young couple lounge on the grass catching up on a bit of rest .
the neon signs of the town are some of my favorite things to see when taking a trip to the city .
it was 4th of july and the park was packed .
i barely made enough food to feed everyone .
the sun started to set we knew the fireworks would start soon .
[male] could n't wait for everyone he had already started drinking .
finally the sky light up with the lights of the fireworks . it was a clear night so you could see the fireworks perfectly .
[female] took several minutes of her time to take a business phone call .
there were quire a few delicious casseroles at the picnic .
i was really glad someone brought a healthy salad .
[female] showed her funny side and did some gymnastics in the grass .
the fireworks show was one of the best i 've ever seen .
i 'm so excited ! we 're having our annual 4th of july picnic !
i brought my famous chicken casserole , it did n't last long !
do n't forget the 7 layer salad , it did n't do quite as well as the chicken casserole , but why would it !
we all get a little antsy waiting for fireworks to start , krissy is off doing flippies and cartwheels in the field .
finally the moment we 've all been waiting for , the fireworks are here !
all of the friends gathered at the park for a 4th of july picnic .
everyone brought a dish to share with the group .
after the meal , everyone walked to the top of the park , where they could see a beautiful view of the city .
they waited along the overlook for the fireworks show to begin .
as soon as it got dark , the sky exploded with the colors and sounds of the fireworks show .
the friends and family gathered at he park for the day .
the casserole that was made was half eaten .
the city skyline looked beautiful that night .
the man was seen near the dock with a bottle .
the fireworks show was spectacular .

here the kids were getting ready for the show .
they even had people walking down the streets .
i 'm not sure but i think captain [female] came to save the day !
everybody was ready for 4th of july .
but we had to go get supplies .
they were n't so ready to wait until nightfall .
once it got dark , we started out small with sparkles .
we made sure to finish the night right with some creativity .
this is where the fireworks were sold .
we walked in to browse .
the girls waited patiently to see the night 's work .
the crowd supporters walked with their posters .

the small-town parade featured people carrying banners and children wearing costumes .
a little kid was dressed as captain location and ran during the parade .
there was a big sign

the children were not happy
about the sign
and they were running .
i went to the local auto show last weekend .
some of the cars there were amazing .

they had been very well kept .
some of them were very expensive .
today i went to the annual classic car show in my town .
i met some of the people who organized the show .
i posed for a selfie in front of a classic green car .
during the show , a lot of people just sat down to rest and have a good chat .

we met up with some friend while we were there .
i snapped a selfie in front of this classic car .
after we all sat around waiting for the concert to start .
the band started setting up it 's instruments .
the classic car convention began and all the cars were excited .
a flashy hot rod was getting the most attention from the female cars .
but [male] was smitten with his neighbor , [female] .
[female] was sleek and yellow , just [male] 's type .
he could tell she was in awe of the hot rod , but [male] decided to throw his hat into the ring and began a conversation with her .
it 's a beautiful sunday at the local auto swap meet . let 's see what they 're got .
look at that t-bucket . mint condition !
classic grocery-getter in blue . perfect for the little woman !
motivated owner ready to strike a deal !
one owner , low miles , whitewall tires and easy financing rolled into one !
i woke up yesterday and i had to clean my room .
it was a mess everywhere .
after i finished i made some food for myself because i was starving .
i spent some time thinking about what to do next .
i decided to head out into the town for the night .
it 's going to be a long day .
tension already fills the air , though bright sunlight streams in the window .
breakfast is still important though , so bagels it is .
then we prepare hard for what is to come .
it has come to this , and everyone attacks .
i woke up and checked the weather outside before leaving .
we saw some seeds spilled on the way to the restraunt .
i ordered a healthy meal .
after we finished we stayed and talked .
i sat on a park bench to take a break from long walking .
i was so grateful for my sister allowing me to move in with her after my divorce .
i started to eat a bit more healthier , and these seeds are part of my journey .
i cut out bread , and just ate meant amd vegetables .
my sister wants me to help her with a healthy lifestyle as well .
she is a sweet person , and deserves all the happiness .
enjoying some good books , love to read .
looking out the window to see what is going on .

the fourth of july is my favorite time of year .
i always enjoy the vibrant colors of the fireworks .
fireworks are so amazing to witness at night when they light up the sky .
i especially enjoy the fireworks that have sparkles and make loud noises .
i look forward to the fourth of july every year and ca n't wait until next year .
watching the 4th of july fireworks show with friends .
firework going up the sky .
huge colorful one blasting in the sky .
beautiful colors and huge explosion .
the grand finale .
fireworks lit up the sky .
they blazed with several different colors .
some went higher than others .
while others turned more into sparklers .
they really set the night on fire .
i always love going to the park on the 4th of july for the fire works .
every time a new fire work goes off you can here the crowd go `` ohhh , aww '' .
this year the town out did what they did last year on fire works .
this year the fire works seemed endless .
this was the last and the best of the fireworks for the night .
the fireworks were spectacular .
there were red ones .
there were also blue fireworks that made a star pattern .
the finale was amazing .
the multicolored fireworks were the biggest .
we decided to take a hike on our day off .
we came across some used fireworks containers .
there was also an abandoned house .
we came across some mushrooms so we picked them .
we began to hear thunder so we decided to head home .
i went for walk in the woods yesterday .
i found some abandoned toys while i was there .
it was very rainy that day .
i managed to spot a rainbow in the distance .
i was tempted to eat some of the mushrooms there .
i decided to go on a photo-walk tonight .
out at one of the kid parks , i was surprised at how empty it was .
there was no one playing anywhere in the area , but the quiet was nice .
i love the parks trails around here for my photo-walks , because you never know what you might find !
today was certainly a great day for it too , or i may have missed out on this !
we went for a walk .
there were lots of weird things out today .
some times we did n't see color .
other times we were very small .
and the clouds were amazing .
we saw mushrooms when camping
we also found abandoned toys but they were not natural .
we got caught in a rainstorm and had to walk through puddles .
at least in the end , we saw a rainbow after the storm .
this was a good camping trip and we brought back a lot of mushrooms .
today was the fourth of july , we had to find our viewing spot a few hours in advance .
we could see the launching pad where the fireworks were to be shot off , we had the best viewing spot possible .
as soon as it started getting late , we were getting more excited for the show to start .
when it finally went off , it did n't disappoint us .
this was probably the best show i have seen since i was a child .
it was july 4th and we were heading into the city to see fireworks .
we got to the city and went to find a good spot for viewing .
this is the city by day .
this is the city by night .
the city made a beautiful backdrop for the fireworks .
we made it to the city to watch fireworks .
we got our spots and watched the barges while the sun set .
nighttime finally came and we took in the beauty of the city .
the fireworks started with red fireworks .
multiple fireworks exploded during the finale .
we went out to the city for the forth of july
we took some pictures of the water in the afternoon
then we waited for the fireworks at night
they were so great and colorful
we loved all the different colors and fireworks
it was a lovely , yet fading day .
we enjoyed the city together , gathering down by the water .
the anticipation for the evening was present , and we reveled in it as we waited .
the sun set , and the city lit up in wonder .
then the festivities began , and the sky responded in kind : lighting up in brilliant flashes of color .
we went out picking blueberries in the morning sun .
they were ripe and ready to be picked .
i could n't believe the size of the patch .
they are a beautiful sight .
my wife took a break and posed on a rock .
i woke up this morning and thought `` what a beautiful morning , we have to do something ! ''
[male] wanted blueberry pancakes , only one problem , we 're all out of blueberries ! it was a sign , we 're going berry picking today !
[male] grabbed his basket and we headed out to the fields .
despite the blueberries looking so delicious , he opted for raspberries today ( it 's okay because they looked equally as delicious ! )
while [male] did the dirty work i sat back to watch the world around me , in all fairness , i did have to take the berries home and make his breakfast still . the pancakes were great , but we 'll be back tomorrow for those blueberries !
we went out to pick some of our own fruits and veggies
there were plenty of fresh blueberries
there were other people that were picking too
the raspberries looked so good
we finally finish and took a break before heading home
i went over to the blueberry farm yesterday .
there were a lot of berries ripe for the picking .
i spent a few hours picking all the berries i could find .
there were so many .
when i was done i sat in the sun eating them .
it was a beautiful day to go out and pick some berries .
the blueberries sweet and juicy .
it was easy to pick enough to last us till winter .
while we were out we found a lot of raspberries as well .
it might not seem like hard work but even berry picking gets tiring in the middle of summer .
i went out with family to get a meal together .
we enjoyed the drinks they served us .
we all had fun joking around .
this was a picture of the whole group .
they were really glad to see each other .
my brother came into town after graduating from college .
we met at a restaurant and had some wine some of our family .
we all got together for a group photo after dinner .
me and my brother took a photo together for the first time in years .
all three of us brother did a final photo of us together .
birthday time for [male] !
his sister and her husband joined .
everyone else was there too .

as did stan 's husband [male] who kept trying to photo bomb the pictures .
we had a great night out with our friends
glasses of wine were enjoyed
we made sure to get in a group picture
[male] and josh wanted their picture taken too
all in all it was a great time with friends
he smiled as he stirred the large beverage container .
they posed with a glass of wine .
people began to laugh .
the group posed together .
another group of three posed while smiling .
today we had a town meeting to figure out what to do with those punk kids in the neighborhood .
word had leaked to the local news station , channel 8 actually had the nerve to show up and record us !
of course with the local news covering the story we could n't discuss what we had originally planned .
[male] did n't get that memo , when it was his turn with the mic he went on and on about how he sits on his front porch throwing firecrackers at kids passing by..opps .
we finished up the meeting early , thanks to the woman seated right here , [female] . it just so happened to be [female] that got the media involved , needless to say , she wo n't be made aware of the next meeting ! !
a meeting was held where office holders made presentations .
there were posters outlining details of agenda .
the meeting was well-attended by spectators , who came dressed in their everyday clothes .
there were professional camera documenting the discussions .
the main speakers were seated around a table , where they took turns addressing the issues .
today we attended at conference for work .
we listened to the speaker talk about efficiency .
the audience listened closely and took notes .
the confrence was being recorded .
we had the chance to ask questions .
everyone gathered around for the conference .
even the janitors were invited .
they listed quietly as new rules were made .
they debated profusely on getting wages .
all in all the meeting was a success , everyone got what they needed .
the conference meeting was very boring .
no one had anything useful to say .
i had to sit there all day long and listen to everyone .
we had even brought in cameras so that we could watch the meeting again later .
i could n't stand it .
we had a fantastic vacation to the mountains this spring .
there were waterfalls coming from the snow melting on the mountains .
we set the timer on the camera to take a photo of us in front of the falls .
my girlfriend was busy reading the maps for the rest of our hike .
she found us a route that brought us to a bridge over the river back to our campsite .
we met the helicopter on the bluest lagoon you have ever seen .
he took us quickly into the air..
and we took a seat by the waterfall..
we enjoyed our lunch and looked at our maps ...
and , we finished the day with one last photograph of the mountain view .
the view of the lake was gorgeous .
there was also a large waterfall nearby .
my girlfriend and i took a lot of pictures .
we brought a lot of food with us .
after we finished eating we packed everything up and headed back home .
the lake and mountains were very beautiful .
a large waterfall was seen streaming down the mountain .
they took a moment to pose in front of the waterfall .
she took a moment to relax and snack .
they crossed the rapids over a bridge .
sights like this one were the reason we set off on a hike in the first place .
the mountains , streams and powerful waterfalls made a big impression on us .
there was nobody we could ask to take our picture but we managed somehow .
lunchtime was also an opportunity to consult the map .
the scenery was constantly changing so the hike was never boring .
we took the family and the dog to the beach .
the ladies had fun just laughing about .
the children had fun playing with water .
she also crawled into tubes .
he had fun with his hair .
finally summer is here . it 's pool time .
i love playing in the pool !
when i need a break from the sun , i hide in my special tube .
my mom likes to do crazy things with my hair .
aah . my mom refueling me so i can have more fun . i love her .
it was summer and everyone was happy .
ricks family was having a blast on the beach .

she was trying to get him to eat .
when i finished playing with my dog at the beach i decided to head back home .
i said goodbye to all of my friends there .
when i got home i had to give my kids a bath .
they were very excited to take a bath .
we tried out some interesting hairstyles .
this is [male] , my dog .
we moved off the grid , this is where our house is .
this is the view from our front porch .
we get water the old fashioned way , by a pump .
i love our new mountain , of the grid living .
we decided to hike location location location .
we spotted a small lake way down below us .
the view of the snowy mountain was fantastic .
the rocky outcroppings were very majestic .
the dog did n't care ; he just wanted to dig .
we took our dog to the mountains with us for our hike .
i photoshopped the picture to show where our house is .
we got farther on the mountain
and we saw what looked like a pipe in the ground .
on the way back down we checked out the other side of the mountain .
i brought my dog with me on the hike last week .
there were a lot of trees out there .
the views were spectacular .
i found some man made devices even way out there .

the dog was alert and ready to go .
a picture of landscape appeared with a location of a house .
the mountain was seen against the sky .
some type of tool was shown .
the mountains met the trees .
we got pretty bored this summer as evidenced by trying to melt a [male] [male] action figure 's crotch with a magnifying glass .
we were pretty bored . it did n't work so well .
then we played some video games for a while and that got boring too !
so we took a trip to the beach , but the water was still too cold to enjoy swimming .
we then drove up to the mountains to then skateboard down them . we finally had a lot of fun .
[male] had an easy life .
he loved to play with his action figures .
he also played video games .
he got bored and tried to light a stick with a magnifying glass . t

all in all he had such a great time
he was working with something on the ground .
a close up of an unknown material was shown .
they were watching something on the tv .
he enjoyed the surf on a calm day .
he got low as he rollerbladed down the road .
it 's been his dream forever to try it out in real life .
the test subject was an unfortunate plastic toy .
vacation is the best time to catch up on video games .
the water was surprisingly chilly and the surf was n't very good .
despite bad surf the boys managed to stay active during the day .
i went to location location location last week .
the views there were spectacular .
i brought my girlfriend along with me .
we took a lot of pictures of the water .
the current was very fast .
during our vacation to location , we saw the most beautiful sunsets over the water .
it was my sister 's birthday , so we had a birthday dinner with the whole family .
they bought her the cutest hawaiian doll cake with matching cupcakes .
the cakes were divine - chocolate with a cream filling and a strawberry flavored fondant on the top .
everyone drank their fair share of the spirits and had a wonderful time .
we had such a great vacation
we were able to see the nearby lake
take in all the great views from around the lake
there was even a small waterfall which was pretty amazing
we had such a great time and plan on going back
we arrived at location location location in the morning ready for a long day of hiking .
the views of the mountains in the distance were amazing .
we stopped by a waterfall to take a couple quick photos .
the water flowed rapidly but the sound of the bubbling water was so relaxing .
we were very careful not to slip as we are n't strong swimmers .
[male] and his girl friend took a trip to location location location .
the lake was beautiful .
they climbed up on a rock to get a good look at the water flowing .
it was a long way down from the rock .

outside , officers gathered and had the entire event surrounded .
soon , officers walked toward the crowd and began to describe [male] 's appearance .
[male] knew he needed to leave fast but did n't wish to arose suspicion so he changed from the strange towel disguise into a more inconspicuous hat .
[male] quickly blended into the crowd and managed to escape the police , today .

this was more my style .
they had a clown to make everyone laugh at intermission .
the start of the rodeo has begun .
brave cowboys attempt to break in animals including hordes .
seeing how long they can stay on top of the bull .
even the kids are involved , riding on sheep .
with a bit of laughter as the dogs are involved mobbing the rider .

he was able to wrangle the cattle in record time .
it was a routine fireworks trial run before the big celebration .
the first rocket tested was `` big red '' known for its vibrant red burst .
however , `` big red '' does n't last for very long .
next up was the crowd favorite `` patriot '' rocket . known for its red , white , and blue combination .
unlike , `` big red '' the `` patriot '' lasts quite some time and ends in a loud burst of blinding white light .

the fireworks started off with a loud bang . i was so startled !
the background of the clouds looked amazing with the red of the fireworks .
the finale was so loud , i wish i brought ear buds . so amazing though .
home done fireworks can be a fun way to spend an evening .
one must always be careful with them , however .
this increases the odds of fun and decreases the chances of a hospital visit .
enjoy the miniature displays of light .
and celebrate the freedom we share .
i have an addiction to fireworks and love lighting them myself .
when i light fireworks i start with the easy ones first .
these are less explosive fireworks i use .
this is the more moderate fireworks i light .
this firework is the most explosive , there 's a little more organization in this bad boy .
dad is the firework master .
i think he lit over 100 fireworks this year .
some of our favorite were the smoke bombs .
we saved the big ones for last .
what a great neighborhood firework show .
our homemade fireworks show was a blast .
we played around with some hand-held fireworks .
the colorful sparklers were fun to twirl around in the air .
other fireworks lit up the area from the ground .
smoke filled the air with each explosive light show .
some friends were together to shoot fireworks outside .
some of the guys held sparklers and used them to light things .
a few of the fireworks went on the ground and rolled around .
some others were bottle rockets in lots of colors .
sparks shot out of the rockets that were on the ground .
the group of friends got together to celebrate the 4th of july .
they watched patiently while the sun went down .
then it was time for the fireworks display .
there were many different colors sparkling in the sky .
after that , they all took turns lighting sparklers .
people around the neighborhood sat together in anticipation of the firework show .
while they waited , children dashed about with sparklers , creating designs in the air with their flailing hands .
some of the adults even joined in as more sparklers were lit .
eventually , the show began , and everyone settled down to enjoy it .
it lasted about 20 minutes , and the finale was spectacular .
everyone loves fireworks , but hates the wait .
we all wait for the sun to set and count the minutes .
then we finally see that one blast hit .
and we know it 's on then .
and afterward , all that waiting did n't seem so bad after all .
we had a party on the fourth of july .
i played around with the exposure and some sparklers .
we lit some colored sparklers too .
there was a huge fireworks display downtown .
i overexposed the finale to see it in all of its glory .
there was a group of people outside watching a fireworks display .
some lights were shaped like different objects .
a few people stood in a circle with some lights .
a large crowd gathered to watch the fireworks in the sky .
several of them were amazing and looked like they were raining down colors onto the crowd .
today we gathered to watch the parade .
the local vfw started the parade off .
there were motorcycle riders .
we even saw a clown band .
of course the horses went last . it was a great parade .
the parade was about to begin when a man and his son were running late on their bikes .
right behind them was his second son .
they made it just in time to hear the parade begin as it did every year with the drummers leading the way .

we took a road trip far away from the nearest town .
we passed mostly large open fields .
then we came to an old historical marker .
after that we found this small blue house .
finally , we found the old small building that was falling apart .
we went to the ruins of a german prisoner of war camp that day .
this was all that was left of the original foundation .

the johnson family arrived for their weekly hike in the woods.they were trying a new spot this week !
they walked for hours and hours that day .
they came across many beautiful things during their hike .
when they stumbled upon a beautiful clearing mom knew she had to take some clippings from the forest so they could always remember this magical day .
now whenever they go on the back porch they see these pots and remember what fun they had and why its important to try new things !
the yard has a nice walkway .
the hill is nice to walk over to some days .
the little enclosed area can be a good place to relax .
the sun was a nice addition to the day ,
as it has been rather dreary all week .
a person goes for a walk in the woods outside their house .
they walk away from their house into the woods .
they marvel in the beauty of nature .
they then walk back into their house .
stopping to admire their potted plants
well it looks like we will be losing some trees .
[male] is clearing out a place to put a gazebo .
so he is making sure that he has plenty of room .

my family and friends went out to the lake . here the children are lined up and ready to swim !
some of us did n't feel like swimming . instead we sat by the lake and enjoyed ourselves .

some of our friends went out into the lake and lit off fireworks . they complimented the sky nicely .

the kids were excited about the pool .
they jumped into the pool .
they dried off in a tent .
they played with the fireworks .
[male] died eating and lighting a firecracker .
many think of fireworks as a time of joy and awe .
fantastic lights that explode across the skies and fill watching eyes with wonderment .
but it 's important to remember that every flash of light is preceded by a loud noise .
a sound so ear-splitting that it can cause headaches . each burst of light comes with a price .
it does n't stop the beauty of the sight , but covering your ears can help the enjoyment .
an experimental rocket company was testing out some radical designs for their fireworks .
the first they tried was the `` dust ball '' . this rocket was designed to be more silent than their previous rockets .
the next up was `` solaris '' , this rocket was designed to mimic the sun , but does n't quite work right .
the company was excited for their newest rocket called `` supernova '' . the rocket at first looks rather ordinary .
however , after the initial explosion a second rocket emerges and bursts creating a stellar effect . the company was n't dissatisfied with this test .
the woman wanted to take pictures of the fireworks .
some came out perfect .
she zoomed in to see the spectacular lighting .
her timing was great as the fireworks exploded .
there were some photos that were n't as great though .
the first firework was purple and white .
the second firework was pink and orange .
the third firework made a loud bang .
suddenly multiple fireworks went into the sky .
the show ended with a shower of light .
celebrating the 4th of july .
and watching a firework show .
fireworks going up the sky .
happy independence day !
the last one for the night .
shown is a closeup of a monument in a memorial garden .
a couple can be seen sitting on a park bench in the distance .
people walk across the stone bridge during the day .
the stone bridge and gazebo look tranquil in the distance .
a shot of the city in the distance shown from the far end of the bridge is a lovely reminder of a special day .
we took a trip to the park outside of the city .
we walked around the pond on a beautiful day .
first we came to a squirrel eating on some nuts .
then we found a bridge going over the water .
after that we saw a duck standing in the water .
the city was very gloomy .
there was no one around .
even the squirrels seemed sad .
it was almost as if things came to a standstill .
a lone duck explored the pond .
we honored the furrys who saved us from the bears .
they will always be remembered .
this park is dedicated to their battle .
this lake is what remains of the bears .
this is the hall of the fallen ones .
it finally happened : the animals took over .
after years of suffering under the human yolk , they devoured each human one by one .
now squirrels had the run of the parks , without having to fear joggers and bikers .
there was no more noise , only the chirps of birds and the rustling of leaves .
occasionally a duck would quack , as if to remind everyone about the car horns that used to honk and annoy .
that night they had a really cool fireworks display .
they had blue and red big explosions .
the purple explosion was my favorite .
they had all kinds of shapes and colours as well .
the final set of fireworks were intense .
best fireworks i 've ever seen !
they made lots of shapes and designs .
buildings looked so cool against the colors and lights !
saw every kind of firework ever made i think !
the end was so bright ! looked like daytime almost !
the fireworks started with a bang and lit up the whole sky with bright white colors .
it then changed to green and red fireworks .
it was amazing to watch all the different colors ; pink was my favorite .
as the time went on , the fireworks continued to go on , filling the sky with smoke .
the show finally ended with final shots of white and sparkly lights , like how it had started .
a firework show is going off with different types of fireworks .
more different types of fireworks going off .
alot of different colors and sizes of fireworks during the show .
different type are combine during the show .

the guy was nice enough to let [female] hold him , and she loved it .
i think [female] thought the dog was going to eat her shaved ice !

the fireworks show was truly spectacular this year , starting off with a huge bang and burst of blue against the blackness of night .
i love these types of fireworks and call them 'zingers ' because they make a high pitched 'zing ' sound as they swirl around coming down .
sometimes i think of how much they resemble the universe , with all the little bright spots stars and the bigger ones planets and suns .
this one was my absolute favorite - purple . usually you do n't see that color very often .
it was well worth waiting for the finale . the sky was totally lit up with beautiful colors and the explosions sounded like canon fire .

this looks like my rice krispies in the morning . am i normal doc ?

while on the bus he realized how lucky he was to have a job and relaxed .
the businessman returned home after a long day .
it was a beautiful day in the city .
so some friends decided to clear some space in the car and go rummaging for scrap metal .
they had heard of a dumpster where there was supposedly a big score .

and when they encountered car troubles , things went from bad to worse .
we went to the city today and found many neat things on a sunny day !

it was beginning to get cloudy ot .
he knew that he needed to get his job completed before the rain came in .

[male] 's brother , [male] , who suffered from a persecution complex , often believed they were laughing at or about him .
[male] 's cousin , [male] , did n't like [female] and wasted no time corroborating [male] 's feelings and reinforcing his suspicions .
but [male] 's best friend [male] tried to persuade [male] that he was just being paranoid , and reminded him that he genuinely had been diagnosed with a persecution complex .
dr. feldspar , [male] 's psychiatrist , tried to explain the same to [male] , but [male] simply did n't believe it , writing it all off as smart-ass college claptrap . instead , he kept a suspicious by bond [female] at all times .

french citizens take to the streets to protest the recent change in austerity policies .
encouraging support for the cause , a man hands out flyers and describes the situation to people passing by .
nearby , a woman shouts a rally cry to bring the group 's voice together .
this draws the children from the peace of their cartoons , as they look at the protests and try to make sense of it .
though sometimes a force of confusion , police assemble on the scene to act as peacekeepers for the neighborhood .
the people filled the roads in anger .
they spoke loudly as they wanted their voices heard .
people looked on in amazement .
they formed a line to hold back the protestors .
they kept a close eye on the protestors .
people gathered in the streets , coming together for a common cause .
promoters took advantage of the situation to hand out flyers advertising their products and services .
angry foreigners shouted and held up signs , demanding change .
many residents watched from their dwellings , scared to come outside but eager to see what would unfold .
police were on standby in case a riot broke out .
during my summer year of college i went on a trip through location and location .
i was surprised and frightened by how different the politics and culture was from what i was familiar with at home .
as protesters marched in the streets , small children watched innocently as if it was normal .
but , for an american like me , the military presence was frightening .
remembering the scenes of protests and military i saw that summer made me appreciate my freedom and home .
it 's the day of the big protest .
local businesses handed out fliers on the cause .
the leader of the protesters brought a bull horn to rally people .
neighborhood children watched the events from their windows .
the city police stood ready for any violence .
some guys are getting ready for a big game .
they get out on the court and start playing .
outside there is bunch people who could n't get in the game .
so the star players go outside to take pictures with fans .

it was a very exhilarating and intense experience .
the atmosphere was electric and there was lots of energy in the crowd .

there was much to celebrate this day !
things got livelier as the night went on .

we did n't expect so much people showing for the ceremony so most students were very intimated at first .

a good fresh beer really brought us together after a very long day .
the house got really busy when everyone finally showed up .

we decided to dig a bit , and look for coins .
the water was really cool and inviting .
it was a sunny day , so we decided to go to the beach .
and of course i had to take a selfie .
the lake is the best place to swing by .
my favorite part about the lake though has to be the softness of the sand .

[male] refuses to take any serious pictures with me ever .
the highlight of the day was the ostrich that we randomly found up the coast .
the beach was sunny and cool .
the sand piles often made objects on their own .
the waves came in gently with breeze .
the skyline showed clouds and blue hues .
a photo was taken for memories .
on the first day of my beach trip , i went swinging outside of our cottage .
there were plenty of dunes and castles from the kids playing .
i loved to watch the waves come in .
as the tide rolled out , the beach shone with sunlight .
i had a great time at the beach !
we took some time to go and visit our old beach house , and i had totally forgotten the swing near the water .
some sand castles we were working on that was ruined by the waves .
me taking a selfie on the beach . i dont usually do this kind of think but i was in the moment .
some drift wood we stacked up . they where lighter than they looked , so it made the stacking really easy .
just outside of the tide there was this ostrich just chilling .
it was very exciting to arrive in such a fabulous spot during our vacation . the view of bay and the ships was fantastic !
after our trip we were very hungry so we stopped to look at the menu of a local cafe .
we decided to go in and eat . here i am enjoying a cup of coffee . the meal was delicious !

later that night we enjoyed the night life and spent some time wandering around town . here we are enjoying a beautiful fountain !
we stopped in for a few cups of tea..
and were blown away by the sights of the area !
a bite to eat usually helps ,
but boating on a full stomach was never a good idea .

the lights dim and the stage light come up .

we decided to walk up instead of taking the elevator .
we saw some great sights on the way up .
the view from the top was amazing . everyone was glad we had taken the time to climb the tower .

it 's an awful long stair climb to the top of the tower , but the family carries on .
the exquisite french architecture is really a sight to behold .
after a long day of touring , [female] newton stops to enjoy the scenic view .
we saw a lot of cool stuff on our trip to location .

the glimpse i caught of these hidden rocks was one of the best pictures taken on this vacation .
the young boy enjoyed the beach , especially getting his feet wet .
the dad looked for shark teeth as he walked along the shore .
the pathway to the boat was filled with footprints of travels that had been there previously .

we got to go sightseeing .
we spent some time at the beach which we all loved .
a nice walk along the beach with the water touching our feet .

this was the mountain we hiked across !
the canoe was fun and relaxing at the same time for the family !
we camped out under the stars and enjoyed our time together
the tent kept our family safe from the elements !
there where few places in this world that i felt peace , but here looking at the snow on the rocks i knew i found it once again .
what struck me as odd was that there was another boat there in the first place . from what i could gather we were alone out here , but there it was . a green boat sitting alone in the water .
we looked down from a high place , and saw the rapids rushing over each rock .
the fire set , and the tent made . we were ready for a wonderful night of cooking over wood coals , and enjoying the heat of the fire .
the sun was going down , but we were not ready for bed . we set a light in the tent so we could read in the peace of the covering .
whenever i need to get away from urban life , i plan a trip to the great outdoors .
while there are plenty of places to visit , i 've always preferred the mountains and hills .
in addition to hiking and climbing , kayaking and other boats also offer a nice get-away .
the beauty of nights out in nature often make me more appreciative of simpler things .
whenever a trip concludes , i always feel invigorated and recharged to take on the busy , urban life back home .

that was quite a run . it is time to refuel so i can hit the slopes again .
long journey ahead .
cleaning snow off the windshield .
ready to get back to skiing .
snow angels
break time for a snack
before we left for our vacation we had to scrape off the snow covered car .
then we headed out to the ski resort .
we caught a ski lift
and skid toward a road .
after we spent some time skiing we relaxed with some snacks .
after a huge storm hit the area , [male] miller decided that this might be the perfect time to hit the slopes - once he scraped the snow off his car .
living in location made it easy for [male] to go skiing whenever he wanted , and it was a rather short car ride to a popular ski resort .
there 's nothing like that first run of the day to get your blood pumping .
after a long day of skiing , [male] heads to the lodge for a hot drink .
on the way to the lodge [male] spots his friend , [male] , with a mysterious looking container filled with assorted candy , as he chuckles to himself , `` to each his own , i guess . ''
the boys had decided to go skiing but first they had to clean off the car .
they drove on the long road leading up to their destination .
when they got there , the slopes were crowded .
one of the boys slipped and fell while carrying his skis over to the lodge .
skiing was tiring but they brought some candy with them for energy .
our first stop on vacation presented a friendly welcome for us .
we then made sure to grab a bite to eat at a local bakery to settle our sweet tooth .
the sun began to set on our first day , but with such a beautiful view , we could n't pass up the opportunity to take a picture .
our first stop in the morning allowed for us to really get up close and personal with history .
our final stop was such a beautiful site . it was such a lovely way to end our vacation .
to start our day tour of location , we had to get a great breakfast to boost our energy .
the architecture was simply unbelievable . every single building was like this .
the castles were remarkable . it really made you think how these were made .
it rained for a brief bit , but that was fine because of all the great things .
the sky even gave us a gorgeous show as our day tour ended .
a beautiful bird was sitting on the ledge
this is a piece of freshly made pie
a beautiful sunset in ancient city
a picture of an old ancient church
a beautiful stone building in ancient city
the bird mad me uneasy as i sat at the restaurant .
i ate my pie diligently so i could leave
nightfall was upon me , i needed to get indoors .
perhaps the church would provide solace from the terrors of dark .
morning has come . another night successfully survived .
seagull about to take flight .
about to eat breakfast before visiting the temple .
looking at the temple from afar .
beautiful temple door , and beautiful statues .
details of the temples tower .
the morning started with the kids wanting to make kool-aid .
after the kool-aid , playdough was a must , before going outside .
we found out that it had snowed over 2 feet last night !
it was necessary for us to start shoveling snow to get to the driveway !
finally , when we were having people over , we had finished the shoveling .
it was a very snowy day out , and dad told the kids that if they shoveled the driveway , they could make play-dough
the kids were excited , so they put in a lot of effort to clear the driveway .
after that , they went inside and dad and mom began to mix the ingredients for the play-dough together .
mom did most of the work and stirred everything up until it was all gooey .
we took the mixture out and let it dry on a plate , then it was ready to be played with !
it snowed overnight so there was a lot of snow to shovel this morning .
it took about an hour to complete the job .
after shoveling i went inside to find this .
it is kool aid and some other things mixed into a pan .
after it was completed i did not know if i wanted to play with it or eat it .
we had started making a weird concoction made out of kool aid .
it was interesting because eventually the kool aid started forming into shapes
unfortunately overnight the organization organization turned white and shaped over the entire city .
people were angry at the kool aid being all over the place .
even schools had to be cancelled for the day from the disaster .
snowed in again . no way to get the car out of the driveway today .
my neighbor did a good job on their driveway but i think they had some help .
what 's a mother to do to on a snowed in day to keep all the kids happy so they do n't fight . i got a bright idea .
clicked on 'youtube ' and found the recipe for homemade play dough . i have some green kool aid in the cabinets so green it will be .
came out pretty good . looks good enough to eat so now i have to make sure that they play with it and do n't eat it .
we love to party !
i really liked the decor .
we had a blast !
i love taking photos .
we needed to relax afterwards

rookie log , 1500 hours : i 've been spotted by a man who appears happy , but i have a feeling his smile is not quite sincere . he invited me to stay for dinner . i fear if i do not except , this message may be my last .
rookie log , a few minutes later : the man called `` chip '' , introduced me to a man he claims is his brother . i ca n't help but think , they are not related at all . side note , research the meaning of `` chip '' , the word alone sounds delicious .
rookie log , 1700 hours : i have passed by these gentlemen several times , and they have yet to make eye contact . perhaps they are guarding a secret substance in those containers . i will make a point of investigating further .
rookie log , 1900 hours : a strange customs seems to be taking place . as each man arrives , he approaches this table and speaks with the old man . he then pours them a drink , and they walk away . i have yet to see any of them reappear . i am requesting with this transmission , permission to accept this mystery liquid and investigate further . please send confirmation or denial as quickly as possible . if i do not partake soon , it will look suspicious .

we set out on a hiking trip .
we ran across a dirt pile that some people were simply amazed by .
we took time to take breaks along the way .
we climbed through different areas .
we ended the day with a nice walk down a path .
on our annual camping trip we took a day hike to the top of this mountain .
we created a scavenger hunt for the kids so that they would stay interested during the long walk .
about halfway up we had to stop to rest . it was a hot day .
the view from the top was amazing and well worth it though .
everyone made it back down safely .

after getting there and investigating the creek , they took a little break on a log .
there were some really unusual looking rocks on their way out again .
there were unusual branches and things too . they explored a desert terrain .
when they got to the end of the trail they found a really strange tree that they used as a marker for next time .
the fellow that owns this said that he can cut an acre of grass in half an hour !
a short walk from the lawnmower , was a creek that had crystal clear water .
of course near water , there are mosquitos . i snapped a close up just before he bit me .
this flower is n't one that i had seen before so i captured a memory of it .
the water looked clean at the river so we assumed that drinking this public water was safe .
today i went on a photography excursion . i got a beautiful shot of the riverbank .
he was playing with a soccer ball so i had to get a shot of him bouncing it in the dirt . the colors really contrasted well .
the earlier rain had left a nice sized puddle so i decided to get an action shot of a rock being tossed in the puddle .
the ice that had formed created a wonderful ripped effect , i just had to snap a close up shot .
i ended my trip with a picture of a beautiful flower , what a wonderful day .
this tractor my family bought ended up being a great investment .
there always some interesting pebbles on our property .
seeing a big like this on my arm was never a good sign .
i loved when the flowers would grow in the spring .
it was always nice to get a little refreshment to keep hydrated
there was once an abandoned lot that needed a little love and attention .
one day a young man on his way to play soccer passed by the lot .
he noticed the many puddles and dirt around the lot , and decided that he wanted to take care of the lot .
he got the entire lot wet to bring some moisture to the soil , and planted a few seeds .
by the end of the summer all the seeds that he had planted were in full bloom .
one day , the kids got together and went into the woods to a quiet stream to play .
[male] was kicking a soccer ball as they approached the stream .
suddenly , it started to rain and the stream became wider and deeper .
[male] slipped and slid into a gulley next to the stream .
after noticing that he 'd scratched himself , he looked up and saw a beautiful flower .
decided to take a day and go to location .
what a wonderful view .
rocks , where do they lead ?
beautiful trees and beautiful sky .
sometimes graffiti is nice
it had only been a few days since she had moved to organization organization from location location , but she felt like she finally found her place .
without the hustle and bustle of the corporate world , she would be free to write her poems , and post them on the neighborhood wall for all the see .
her backyard was practically a forest , which was such a deep contrast from her life in the lifeless concrete jungle . she savored every moment as she looked up at the canopy .
for her lunches , she would make her favorite pizza which was topped with locally grown arugula and parmesan cheese .
she finally found the peace she was looking for , and she walked her son each day into the forest to pick berries and harvest mushrooms .
i love being outside and enjoying nature .
it 's nice to sit and just appreciate everything that it has to offer
this park has the most interesting steps that i love to walk up .
the steps take you to some amazing picture opportunities , like this picture of the sun peaking through some trees .
even out here in nature you can see things that people have left behind to leave their mark .
just enjoying a nice day in the park
the swings were very peacfull
the old stone stairs that lead up to the trail
very old huge trees on the hiking trail
i found a marking on a tree that i very much agree with
maddy had always loved going outside .
she always found the neatest places to take pictures !
she would always try and tell a story . like why are the stone steps there ?
the trees were always up so high that you could n't see the sun . it was beautiful
she even loved taking pictures of people who had been there before . usually to end her day
we saw the changing of the guard .
there were lots of horses .

jets flying over the palace was a wonder . it was not something that i expected to see , and it was rather nice when it happened .
we could seem some of the royal family standing on the balcony , and we cheered when they waved .
in the morning we woke up and got ready for the day 's hike .
when everyone was accounted for , we got going .
the forest was green and misty .
we crossed a plateau and stopped for a moment to talk .
then it was back into the beautiful green woods .
dad sitting back , watching his boys in this majestic wilderness .
what a view it is from up here .
the whole gang has gathered around to view the scenery before hiking down .

you 'd spread out for a moment to search the beach for shells and things .
we dug in our secret spot to bury a capsule .
and before we left , visited the cliff that looks down on the crashing waves .

we have more flowers to plant because our dog dug them up .
this is our pet dog , rex . he likes to dig .

so they decide to pose with a stuffed animal instead .
i 'd been working on the dam for two years now and it felt so great to see everything finally come together .
it was definitely one of the most elaborate projects that we 'd worked on in the past .

he was here , this was real , he was making his first contact with a representative , and for some reason , there is a man that keeps taking his picture .
two women approached , no doubt subconsciously drawn to his space stench , and the cameraman was delighted to take their photo .
after an evening of illuminating discoveries , zanith found himself famished , so he decided to find some food ; and low and behold a man with a camera showed up ; how do they know ?
trying to enjoy his meal , a woman suddenly sat beside him and began asking questions that seemed a little too coincidental . a man took his picture again , and zanith wondered if he had chosen the right mission afterall .

then they showcased another one
they kept show these brilliant fireworks
as the show went on , it got more intense
finally , they ended with a mind blowing firework show .
at the fireworks show i was amazed at the amount of them this year .
this firework of a solid white color was truly dazzling as the light sparkled out .
these quick short bursts provided for quite a light show .
the series of colorful blasts seemed like the finale as it lit up much of the sky .
many of the fireworks such as this one had very unique shapes .
the family went to their favorite annual fireworks show on july 4th .
the show had purchased amazing white fireworks that made a thundering noise when they blew up .
they also displayed fireworks that blew up into shapes like a cross .
however , everyone 's favorite firework was a bright white one that streaked across the sky .
the grand finale was nothing short of spectacular , with bright colors , loud bangs , and overwhelming applause .
this is a building in location .
on the fourth of july they let off fireworks from their building .
the fireworks are very unique they look like they are exploding from the building .
sometimes the fireworks just come from the top of the building .
the city around the building really enjoys this display of fireworks that is very exciting and unique .
we decided to go into the city for the new years eve event .
it is supposed to be the city 's most spectacular firework display ever .
we were amazed to see fireworks cooming off the building .
the building looked like it was exploding .
it was the most amazing fireworks display we ever seen it lived up to our expectations .
location had their annual firework show last week .
the tallest building began shooting out orange and blue fireworks .
it was followed by red fire raining out of the top of the building .
then a golden stream of fire began shooting out .
finally the building shot out its finale fireworks .
at the show the building was very tall
then it started to amaze us with a firework show
it continued for quite some time
we were having fun watching the display of fireworks
the last one they showed was truly breath taking .
everyone is gathered at the bottom of this tower for the fireworks to start .
the fireworks start with beautiful yellow lights .
following the yellow fireworks , there are bright red ones .
after that , there are lovely white fireworks going off .
as the fireworks come to an end , the fireworks dwindle down .
we were so excited to have some fun .
we saw the lights from afar and knew we were near our destination .
the illuminated ferris wheel off in the distance was call our name .
we had finally arrived at location location .
it was a great night and there were a lot of people as we were leaving
is there anything worse then a boat ride when you are sea sick ?
he forgot to tell his friends that boat rides are not the best thing for him . he gets sick in the bath tub .
although the views of the shore are beautiful and almost make up for the seasickness .
who can resist feeling bad after seeing such a happy face .
still he is happy as he stumbles off the boat and makes his way home .
[male] just remembered he had tickets tonight to the grand opening of the amusement park .
he waited on line with his friend [female] .
they took a boat ride to get to the park .
the gate of the amusement park was lit up beautifully .
[female] and [male] walked around looking at all the rides .
he is holding his face because his tooth is aching .
the bridge at night is a lovely sight .
we are touring the city by boat , and the ferris wheel looks awesome .
the entrance of location location is quite interesting .
the streets are very active at this time of night .
[male] was hungover and did n't want to go to the fair .
walking the illuminated bridge got him in the mood , though .
the sights were beautiful from a distance .
up close the entrance gate made a powerful impression .
eventually , [male] left the fair feeling satisfied and glad he 'd gone .
[male] and i decided to take our first date downtown to the big fourth of july show .
the fireworks were excellent ! this was over the water .
huge fireworks that seemed to last forever .
during this big bright one we kissed . it was amazing !
the grand finale was quite american and beautiful . we kissed again under this amazing sky art .
we attended the independence day fireworks show .
it was a lovely , clear evening .
the moon was out and the stars were bright .
the firework show started small .
by the end of the show the fireworks display was awe inspiring .
my friends were at the fireworks show tonight . the beginning of the show was brilliant .
next , the fireworks let off from the bridge and lit up the river .
then there was shot of fireworks that went in every direction , almost creating a rainbow .
after that there was a barge that let off fireworks . the display was so brilliant that it reflected off the river .
finally , the grand finale . there were so many things to see that you did n't know where to look . it was so beautiful .
mom and dad went out to see the fireworks .
it was always exciting to see the sky light up so bright .
some of the fireworks were bigger than anything we had ever seen .
it got so bright sometimes you thought it was day time alerady .
the big finish filled the sky with color and sound , really making for an exciting time .
the couple at the fireworks took a selfie to remember their experience .
beforehand , the harbor was silent .
the fireworks began with a beautiful constellation of white lights .
the colorful fireworks followed shortly , though .
the grand finale was a magnificent end to the spectacle .
it was the 4th of july and we were ready to go watch the most spectacular firework show around .

some of the fireworks were very loud and scared us like this one .
some of the fireworks made no noise at all , but they were still pretty .
the grand finale was great . there were many fireworks let off all together which made for an intense show .
our family loves to watch fireworks .
we had the perfect view of all the glowing brightness of the event .
we had decided to watch from the hotel balcony .
i think the view was stunning and we made the right choice .
the last few fireworks that went off just topped our night off beautifully .
boom ! boom ! boom ! the wonders of a fireworks display .
the designs an colors of fireworks are mesmerizing .
some look like crystals .
others look like pom-poms .
the finale is always the best part of a fireworks display .
there are many different kinds of fireworks going off tonight .
some of the fireworks are multi colored .
one firework looked like a giant star in the sky .
one of my favorite designs are when the fireworks look like a big circle .
the night was beautiful , the fireworks were great . even the dwindling fireworks looked lovely .
on the fourth of july , everyone on the street enjoyed a spectacular firework show . here is the fist of many .
these ones were cool because they spit out what looked like doughnut sprinkles .
this one looked like the organization organization organization blew up .
somehow all of these kind of fireworks had such a loud boom they set off all the neighbors car alarms .
this was the beginning of the end ... a spectacular finale .
we waited for the sun to finish setting before the fireworks began
the city looked beautiful when all the lights are on .
the fireworks began with a beautiful blue display of lights .
things started to intensify when the grand finale began .
it was a great night with lots of great fireworks .
we decided to go in the city to watch the fireworks display tonight .
we decided to take out our boat that we have docked by the pier
the fireworks show started .
we decided to get closer so we could have a better view .
the fireworks display was stunning we were disappointed when it ended .
the city 's skyline lit up at sunset .
the glow of lights decorated the harbor .
fireworks were set off as the city celebrated .
the boats gathered in the harbor to watch the fireworks .
the grand finale glowed bright as day .

this shot will keep us satisfied for years to come .
i plan on having them framed and matted for gifts to those i love
it was time to celebrate our new years .
we headed off to the event .
there were many pretty colors .
this tower was very large and looked like it went on forever .
it was a great night and a new years party i will never forget .
last weekend we went on vacation to celebrate new year 's .
we saw the location location and it was covered in lights .
it was very tall .
we were too scared to climb up it .
happy new year everybody !
there are different ways to view the tower , this is from far away .
the closer we get , the more vibrant the colors get .
as we near , it is becoming aware just how tall the tower is .
upon entering , i took a picture , and the height , as well as the colors , left me in amazement .
i had to take a picture as we left , as a momento of our trip .
it'a always been my dream to see the location location .
as we walked down the street towards the tower , it shown beautifully against the night sky .
when we finally arrived , looking up at the massive structure was breathtaking .
the more i looked up to the top of the tower , the more excited i became that i was going to head to the top .
at the entrance we were greeted with a happy new year sign above the doors .
the day of fair rides starts with the shirl-a-whirl .
it 's so fast it 'll make your head explode .
next up is the hatchet . the g-force is so strong most people pass out .
and then , the mega bumper cars . broken bones are the norm .
last , the scenic view of the beautiful cascades on the ferris wheel .
i have always wanted to ride a ferris wheel .
i got the opportunity this spring to finally go on one .
as i looked up i got a bit fearful .
in my mind i thought i was going to get dizzy like i was on a fast ride .
it felt like i was on a ride that kept spinning and spinning .
my family and i spent the day at the amusement park .
we went on a ride that spun us around .
the next ride took us upside down .
we relaxed on the bumper cars .
we ended the day with a slow ride on the ferris wheel , where we could enjoy the view .
[female] was so excited to take a trip to the fair !
his favorite ride was always the organization organization . he was n't scared of heights at all .
riding the wheel was a thrill he always remembered for the whole year until the next year 's trip .
this year , he decided to also try the tilt-a-whirl .
that was a big mistake . the world spun around for hours after he got off that very fast ride ! he decided to stick to the organization organization .
the amusement park has many rides , including one that spins very quickly in circles .
one of my favorite rides is this one , where they increase the speed of the ride .
this one looks scary , we are waiting for our brave sister to get off the ride .
there are also fun rides during the night time that light up .
the amusement park is right by the water side , what a beautiful location for it .
we had finally arrived at location toy shop .
the kids loved to see that the train was coming .
what a surprise , organization organization is riding the train .
there were hard workers all over like these mice cutting cheese .
mrs. claus looking over some christmas inventory
i had never been to organization organization organization organization so i was excited to finally get to go .
the only way in was by train .
once inside we were greeted with goodies provided by location 's helpers .
the little animals were busy with the toys .
after we finished the tour we had to take the train out to get back home .
the north pole is lovely in summer .
a colorful toy train chugs all around .
elves with nut allergies should avoid this giant bag of almonds .
giant rodents impale the cheese .
even the colorful toy train looks unnaturally cheerful .
we are at location location location location where the family is going to enjoy the day .

today was my first trip to location !
there was sushi !
there was also some beautiful ocean sights !
the tram whizzed overhead .
the city bussled at night .
some passengers ride on the bus trying to make their way to the ocean .
the coast is rocky and has manmade plastic lining the side .
there are bridges for cars to drive over .
they are also currently working on the bridge itself .
even at night the bridge is being worked on .
the class trip is today .
the class voted to go to the ocean .
they drove over very tall bridges .
they got stuck in traffic moving slowly past a construction site .
finally they drove through the bright city lights at night .
the new app i got allowed me to tag people in a random photo i took on my bus ride to the beach .
when i got there , i tried some local delicacies involving fish .
i spent some time at the local jetty , watching the sea .
i then head back and waited for my bus under the overpass .
it got quite late before the bus arrived .
my civil engineering class went on a field trip .
we stopped by the ocean .
we observed rail and highway projects .
this was suitable for the engineering class .
i 'm especially fascinated by multi-layer highways .
i went to the market yesterday .
i wanted to set up my new motorcycle stand .
i had a lot of customers coming soon .
i set up on the pier .
i knew the boats would see me .
the mirrors reflected the sun .
my favorite was the green robot .
there were buildings with chinese writing on them .
the lady prop was my second favorite .
the toilet looked like it was a prop .
my walk around the japanese town was quite interesting . i saw a building with circular mirrors hung outside in a pattern .
there was a statue of what looked like an alien baseball catcher .
uncle [male] pointed at me from the roof of another building .
there was a balloon character with what looked like balls for hair .
i finally found a toilet but it was a unisex one so i was kind of cautious using it .
check out the mobile market .
they had signs on both sides .
i like the designs in location .
i ca n't read most of the signs .
while we were there we checked out the harbor too .
my friend and i decided to visit location .
there were interesting statues everywhere .
we had a great lunch .
my favorite character was there and looking great .
even the restrooms were interesting !
it was a great day on the beach with friends .
there was a carnival near by , so we visited it !
a lot of people were at the carnival .
they offered up some not so appetizing fare here .
there were the usual carnival games which we had fun playing .
my wife , my sister and her sister share a moment together after we arrive to the beach .
after leaving the beach my wife 's sister catches me looking strangely at my wife .
i get her back shortly after as her face can attest to in this picture .
once we were done with our picture taking fun i stumbled upon this strange ice cream recipe .
to my amazement after passing the sign my wife decided to try her luck at a game .
i went with my girlfriend and some of her friends to the beach .
she gave a slight smile everytime i attempted to tell a joke .
her friend on the other hand gave me a disgusted face .
we saw a sign for , clams , beer and ice cream . we decided to try it .
afterwards , we played some carnival games .
three lovely women are enjoying a day at the beach .
they have not seen each other in a while and so take a picture as a reminder of this momentous occasion .
they stroll along the beach area amongst a large crowd of people .
soon , it is noon and so they get lunch consisting of clams , beer , and ice cream . yay !
after lunch , they have some more fun by playing games and win some prizes .
i went with my sisters to the beach today .
we checked out the boardwalk too .
there was a band playing .
what an odd combination .
we played some games on the boardwalk .
so this is the place where it 's going to happen , at long last the end has come .
walking down the corridor i shudder with anticipation .
the architecture here is otherworldly , certainly beyond the skill of even the most skilled human craftsmen .
in the shadows , eery groanings lurch through dim doorways .
and in the center of it all , the fires already await me .
we entered the foreboding looking building .
once we entered we were greeted with a long spooky hallway .
the chapel was well lit , but old and rustic .
other areas of the building required candlelight to see where you were going .
we enjoyed our time in the old building , but were happy to see daylight because the place was quite spooky .
the door into the church looked like barn doors .
once inside , it was huge and made you feel very small .
there were rows and rows of pews .
at the other end , there were rows of candles lit on the altar .
there was another door leading out on the side of the church .
i checked out this old building while on vacation .
on the inside , it looked like a church .
this was what the ceiling looked like .
more church looking designs .
they were no lights so we had to light candles .
my friend and i went to visit an old church for my birthday .
i had always been fascinated by this building .
it was as majestic as i imagined !
we left the beautiful church at closing time .
what a wonderful way to celebrate my birthday !
the first thing we did on tuesday was go to a baseball game .
my wife ordered a classic soda and it was delicious .
we walked outside to admire the building .
near the field , we found a lush garden .
these sunflowers took a few minutes to find and appreciate .
we took in the sights of the city , so we went to the ball park .
then we went to some of the museums .
on our way , we passed some pretty flowering trees .
we went by this wonderful mote .
at the end of the tour we found these pretty flowers .
watching the baseball game from high up in the nosebleeds .
sharing a huge soda on our laps while watching the game .
the entrance to the stadium was vast and welcoming .
the garden outside was very well cared for and very pretty with its hedges and ponds .
the sunflowers were very pretty sticking their yellow heads out to be seen .
all good things come in the spring . going to baseball games .
having a organization at the game .
leaving the stadium inspired by your team 's win .
walking past the park on your way to your car .
seeing the flowers bloom in your yard when you get home and can take a nap in the air conditioning on your couch .
we use to love going to the baseball games every saterday .
we would sit in the stands drinking coke with our buddies .
it would n't seem like much afterwards but for fun we would de a little site seeing .
we loved looking at all the unique gardens .
my favorite was ending the day just looking at the sunflowers .
recently there was a rally downtown .
it almost reminded me of a circus .
the people were practically naked and had colored chalk on their bodies .
they joined together to fight for their cause .
the paraded up and down the streets .
naked protestors heading off to get painted .
the painted protestors march on and shout .
the protestors gather and decide what to do about the crowd .
the protestors decide to form a circle around the intersection .
the protestors then decide to take their whole show on the road and form a parade .
the nude pride rally was the first of it 's kind in our little state . it started out early in the morning .
there were many people in the crowd taking pictures .
the participants were n't many but they had colorful dye thrown all over their bodies .
they then held hands in a circle to represent their cause .
later , another parade went through town but these people were dressed .
the street fair in location was kind of weird .
the people in the parade were naked .
they walked down the street as a group .
then they stopped and did some kind of ceremony .
after the ceremony they continued walking .
the parade had many
who were naked .
they did not mind
because they were having fun
when the people came .
today was the day of the finals and i was nervous .
we started out slow because they defense was really good .
they even made some pretty good shots .
we were able to come back and make some god shots as well .
in the end this was the shot that made the win .
the boys were getting beat by the other team by halftime .
they started to make their comeback .
they scored and scored in the second half .
by the end of the game they had tied it up .
with one last shot they won the championship and felt as if they had won a long hard fight .
i was asking for a pass all game .
we could n't play defense well enough to win .
they made point after point against us .
nobody could block their shots .
we lost the game .
the boys basketball game was non stop action .
there was always a fast push to score .
defense was good so a lot of shots were taken .
the boys showed some great energy and drive to really win the game .
you could see the excitement and determination in almost every play .
the students were very excited for the tournament match .
these basketball players practiced long and hard for this moment .
the student tried for a layup shot that was crucial to tying the game .
the home team was delivering magnificent defense .
the competitive spirit of basketball was fully displayed at the exciting tournament match .
my sister han and i were in a large parade in our town . it was our first one . this is us .
my good friend lu was there , does n't she look beautiful . she was walking right behind us in the parade .
this was coming up the street behind us . i jumped out of the parade to snap a few pictures .
of a dragon first , it was so brightly colored ! i loved how it moved down the street .
the next dragon was so cool . it looked angry . it scared me badly enough that i had to run to the restroom ! !
i was able to go see the chinese new year parade this year .
watching the performers in the dragon were done with artistic impression
the chinese women showed exquisite beauty in their dance ,
the children loved the slow moving dragon down the street .
i was taken in by all of the attention to details on their costumes .
last week i had the chance to watch a festival .
there were many colorful dragons that were dancing on sticks .
lots of people there wore elaborate costumes .
some of the dragons were scary looking .
afterwards i realized that i had a great time and i ca n't wait to go again .
while visiting location we were able to see a little festival .
there were many different costumes there .
there were big floats of all different types .
some of the floats were colorful .
most of them were dark colored and very scary looking .
every year , i get dressed up for the neighborhood street fair .
there 's a tradition of wearing funny , wild hats . this year i outdid myself with my heart themed hat .
when i was little , bigsmile the clown used to scare me , but not any more !
the dragon also looks much less scary now that i 'm a teenager .
in my childhood memories , he 's very menacing . it 's strange to grow up and see things differently .
the fair was full of energy .
there were so many prizes to win .
many men and women wore costumes .
many of the performers were dancing to music .
we played games and celebrated life together .
the night of the local carnival was a great one , but there was no fish .
[male] and aki decided to remedy that the next morning .
they gathered a group and planned a massive fishing exodus .
at first no one showed up which made the friends sad .
in the end dozens of people gathered and fished tons .
the carnival was in town and could be seen easily at night .
small clowns made of glass sit for sale on a table . ornately colored and delicately posed .
a man wearing orange robes and a orange balloon crown talks to the crowd .
brightly colored pants are being worn over the man on stilts walking around .
a tossing target stands mocking the game players with a face through a sign stating hit me if you can .
i got to tag along with some friends to a local annual carnival this weekend .
we made sure to get on of the awesome baloon crowns everyone was wearing .
we took a group photo , it was silly .
we even got to take a small boat ride in between some of the rides .
we made sure the whole team got to be in the photo .

on our way to the car , [male] got behind the sign with the hole and we hit him with water balloons .
this district of location location is known for its colorful art and dance .
the buildings are painted in a way that can not be mistaken for anywhere else .
the location location is part of argentine pride .
even the dogs are happy to be part of this awesome area .
but the rest of the country , the sinister history post-peron , is not so gorgeous .
we recently took a trip to wisconsin , and the type of architecture there was amazing .
the colors that were used for the houses , reminded me of a carribean villa .
the way the tree is growing reminds me of an individual with bad posture .
our dog was not a fan of the bright colors on the building .
this road seemed like it went on and on for miles .
buildings in location were very colorful , even if they were old .
each one would be painted in bright vibrant colors .
it was never completely one color either . the stairs would be one color , the handrail another , and the side panels another .
sometimes they had color paintings on them .
yet there were places that did n't have any color on them . these places looked so run down , with rusted cars on front of them .
people walk in the streets next to an old building .
on closer inspection the building 's walls have an array of different colors .
a large and oddly winding tree gives contrast the the building .

the neighbors had their own cow for milk .
a series of coastal wind turbines to help offset the power costs .
one of the great sausage restaurants we ate at .
took a day trip into the city today for the first time in months .
i almost forgot how confusing some of the street signs are .

dont know what these things are but theyre pretty cool .
went to my favorite diner to end the day .
there was a ton of traffic .
they do not eat cows around here .
we had a great rental car !
somehow , the high tech winmills did not take away from the beach scene .
we found a great little cafe .
my vacation was an unusual one .
i did n't expect to see cows in the city .
we travel around mostly by car .
i was shocked to see when generators along the beach .
this is one of the restaurants where we ate .
the way this flower blossomed out the ground gave me a feeling of hope .
the kids were constantly bugging me to ride the ferris wheel , and the answer still has not changed , it 's no .
this corn on the cob was so delicious , i enjoyed eating it a lot .
at first glance , i thought this was a old rocket ship , unfortunately for me , it was not .
the booth owner was preparing for the crowd that would arrive to play the games .
i love going to the fair !
they always have the best food .
i like to try out all the different kinds of food .

as is the homemade chilli .
and who can forget the corndogs , not this guy !

on a perfect weathered day , they make their way to the carnival and stop by the ferris wheel .
the corn is delicious and the first bite is underway .
the meat stew looks very tasty and inviting .
a perfectly fried corn dog with a stripe of mustard looks appealing .
some type of creme filled crepe with powdered sugar is a fine compliment to a night of eating .
the flower was pretty
and the wheel was big .
there was corn
and the people were happy
that they saw the stuff .
i have taken a few photography classes to improve my photography skills .
we are working on architectural details this time .
i got this shot of the staircase by laying on the ground .
this shot was take beside the christmas tree looking up the the ceiling .

while on vacation we stopped at some very nice places .
this place was amazing to visit because of their large clocks that were on display .
this building had some amazing stained glass .
this building was known for their stair cases .
the view from up here was amazing .
jay was so excited he got chosen for this photo project for work .
he was to take architecture shots of the newly opened train station .
the detail that went into design was easy to see painstakingly done .
the grand stair case was by far the best .
the humorous dog statue made me laugh as i exited . thinking to myself what a great job i have .
we arrived and were instantly amazed at the architecture
we then stood in awe at the stained-glass
then i looked up at this massive staircase of some kind
then we gazed at the ceiling in wonder
finally , i stood back to get a better view of the staircase
as long as i live , i 'll never forget my visit to the grand cathedral .
there was a huge inside clock tower , a wall of roses and windows that brought in the outdoor light .
the stained glass was unbelievable . i could have looked at it for hours .
the curved staircase to the alter , custom build , was amazing .
but nothing quite compared to being on the front alter , looking out at the seats and imagining what it must have looked like for the royal wedding .
today i decided to take the kids to location location location amusement park .
after we paid we entered the park . the kids were so excited to see the location statue .
first off we decided to head to the organization organization . we could see the whole park from up here .
then feeling a little braver , we tackled the roller coaster . wow what a ride !
the sun started to go down , so we decided it was time to head home .
there was once an empty park in the middle of the city that hardly anyone visited .
so the people of the city decided to vote on what to do with the empty space .
once the voting was done it was decided to turn the park into an amusement park , and the first thing they built was a roller coaster .
next they added several game booths for the kids and adults to enjoy between rides .
within a very short time the amusement park was complete , and all the citizens enjoyed the park 's fun entertainment .
we went to a carnival last november .
the carnival people had allready put out christmas type decorations .
the ferris wheel was huge
the roller coaster looked so scary i would not get on it .
luckily they had kiddie rides for the little ones and me .
we all looked forward to a fun day in the park .
we began the day with inspirational speakers .

we decided to walk downtown where we might be able to find a restaurant .
the family got to the amusement park ready for some excitement .
the kids could n't wait to go on the roller coaster .
all the twists , turns and loops really made the riders scream .
even at night the park still looked exciting .

i walked around for a little while and found this cool little island area full of water . you could actually walk down in the water but it was too cold .
there was a cool building full of neat stuff like this . it did n't move or anything but it was pretty to look at .
after i ate and walked around for a good bit of the evening it eventually got dark and the lights came on . this one was my favorite until i looked over to my right and saw a huge castle .

i want to live here because of the decorations

too bad the bumper cars did n't work anymore .
we thought about going for a swim , but the water was disgusting .
some farmers grow beautiful flowers , like these tulips .
some farmers produce herbs , and garlic , and peppers , and vegetables .
this farmer grows an amazing mustache .

at the end of the day , the farmers happily leave the city .

at night , they enjoyed the view of the needlepoint tower .
they could n't wait to enjoy the city life at night .

i 'm guessing this man was scottish .
this is the sign outside .
this city is really quite large and beautiful at night .

there were also many other fantastic products at the market .
there was also many interesting characters .
the sign is one of the most iconic signs in the city .
the city looks magical when lit up at night .
let us start our tour of the city at the local cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© .
some of the buildings are old and have their own personal character .
even the bridges are gracefully arched .
there are new structures mixed with the old .
the city is a combination of the old and the new to create a vibrant tapestry .
a really large ferris wheel lit up at night .

after passing the ferris wheel we made our way to the large shrine at the edge of the town .
once inside we looked up in the ceiling to see quite the sight .
after capturing the ceiling we made our way toward the stage of the shrine where workers were beginning a ceremony .
finished with the shrine for the day i captured my wife smiling at the sunset against the wall .

the cathedral was beautiful and huge . the decorations were very ornate . this was our favorite stop .
as we were leaving we saw this mansion.we all wondered who lived there . it was a great day
i started off the day with some black and white photography before i got underway . finding the right shot was hard , but i did pull it off , getting the one i wanted .
from there , i switched to color film . working on my exterior shots , i found a bright orange , brick-worked looking building to photograph .
i then moved on , scouting for a site until i found just the right one . the skyskrapers looming above were a nice touch , and i snapped my photo .
i decided i wanted at least one good interior shop . the lovely architcture of a local building with it 's glorious columns served useful .
one final photograph for my portfolio of a more mundane exterior surrounded by trees would serve as the capstone for today 's succesful hunt .
the playing area had screens to keep from losing the balls .
there are over a million bricks in this building !
tall blue and white skyscrapers .
the inside of the church was like a canyon .
the house we stayed in .
we are starting our tour of diverse architecture .
some structures are plain with a few arches for embellishment .
now it is time to view the mall and its interior design .
sometimes the hangings look like giant christmas ornaments .
you can never tell what is inside a building when you look at the outside .
a family decided to spend the afternoon together in the city .
they rode the carousel together .
they then spotted a creature in the water .
it was a chilly day near the water , but they still had fun .

the city street is very crowed with shoppers and tourists .
the owners of the stalls are putting the final touches to organize their merchandise .
some stalls are selling vintage books .
there are also stalls that have fruits and vegetables .
the stands selling sculptures done by local artists are also very popular .
we went shopping for art this week .
we looked at many pictures and could not decide which one to buy .
so we ended up taking pictures of the ones we likes .
especially the colorful ones were interesting .
we ended up buying this piece as it reflects both of our interests .
my sister and i went on a tour of location this summer .
we visited local czech stores to see what they were selling .
my sister found a souvenir calendar she liked .
there was a produce stand that sold all kinds of delicious things .
at a farmer 's market i found this device , which i assumed was used as a mortar and pestle .
my trip was wonderful , even the day i spent shopping for souvenirs .
there were many things to select from to help me remember my vacation .
i liked this calendar with a picture of one of the historical sights i visited .
remembering all the great new foods i sampled made me want to take some home , but i thought i would have to settle for this colorful picture .
then , i found this unique nut cracker that i could take home as a souvenir to always remind me of my great vacation .
it is a great day for this family to go shopping .
there are so many choices of great foods .
it is always helpful to have an explanation of the foods .
the fruits and vegetables look so exciting .
and you never know what you will find at the store .
lord trash heap demanded all the people of psychedelic town obey him .
the people thought he was just kidding until ...
he brought out captain pumpkin head to threaten them with death .
and mr skull to keep them in line and
mr. dog to entertain him .
the sign was amazing how it came out of the wall .
i had to dress like a hot dog .
there was a lot of artwork there .
the skull was a fan favorite .
i liked the murals on the wall .
the halloween art show had some very interesting artwork .
we were able to walk through and see everyone 's art .
the entire building was full of halloween decor .
this skeleton was a great addition to the decor .
jame dressed up as a hot dog after the art show to pass out candy .
we decided to go to a well known goonies exhibit .
we got into character as most do .
the professionals were really in character .
it was actually a little scary .
the artwork was amazing !
if you are going to a party you may as well dress up .
there is so much artwork to peruse .
some faces are warm and welcoming .
other faces , like this crystal skull , are a bit frightening .
but this costume reminds us that is it lunch time .

giant spiders loomed overhead .
and in the middle of the park they had a big organization wheel .

the first ride they took was a slow ride on the water .
the enormous spider scared the little ones .
the ferris wheel ride was the ride they enjoyed before they left the park for the evening .
the kids parents brought them to an amusement park .

these men were also supporters of our band .
this band was really entertaining to the crowd .
these women said they were also interested in my work .
i was happy that we went to see this band at this concert .
we went to an awesome day time music festival today .
we ran into alot of our friends . it was a day of fun in the sun .

we ended the day with some mini golf ! nice relaxation on the astroturf to end a fun day .
a couple of friends and i went to a concert . this one of them .

they found they had a great spot to see all of their favorite performers play .
[female] lost track of her boyfriend in the crowd .
finally she spied him , but he was with another girl .
the band started playing so loudly that she could n't effectively tell him off .
it was then that she realized the girl he had been talking to was a lesbian .
[female] was able to relax and enjoy the band .

here was a display that so bright and beautiful .
the display was located in a fountain and was just amazing to see .
here is my family downtown walking and enjoying the show .
the family was excited for the light parade .
some of the floats zoomed by , leaving a trail of light .
there were brilliant colors and designs , including teddy bears .
the lights could be seen for miles .
the parade ended at a large , lit-up building where people could view the floats up close .
what i love most about ferris wheels is probably different than most people .
i love how many different faces they can show . at sunset , they are like a magical wheel in the sky .
when they start moving , they look like a blurred circle .
if you squint , they are like a lit-up hula hoop .
if you just look a tthe top , they almost look like a coin in its side . i love them so much .
the photographer wanted to showcase the new ride in an artistic way .
the ride has just been built and added to the theme park .
the theme park will open during the night so he wanted to show case the image of it beautifully at dusk .
the photographer wanted to show just how fast he ride spun .
he also wanted to artistically show the lights of the ride at night .
i wanted to find out how different i could make a subject look by using different settings on my new camera , so i started with this snapshot of a organization wheel .
next , i changed the light settings and got this great shot in the evening , but it still looked like a ferris wheel .
i slowed the shutter speed for this shot and turned the organization wheel into just a giant wheel .
later in the evening , the lights on the ferris wheel and the slow shutter speed yielded this great picture at a different angle .
my favorite picture of the ferris wheel was this one at night with the lights , a slow shutter speed and a unique angle , i am very glad i experimented enough to get this shot .
what a wonderful ride we will be on next , the farris wheel .
some of my friends were already on the ride , they lucked out and got on it before i could .
look at the beautiful sunset , it was an amazing day .
the lights on the farris wheel made it that much nicer when it went around . what a beautiful view .
here is another great one of the side , makes it look even better .
at the carnival was a ferris wheel .
i was amazed by the ferris wheel during sunset .
it was so cool to take some long exposure shots of the ferris wheel .
then i started taking more photos when it got darker and they turned on the lights .
this is my favorite shot with the lights on and the long exposure .
there were some great fireworks this year at the park .
that one looks like a green fluffy dandelion .
there were several explosions in that rocket , what a site .
some of them looked so delicate .
some of the fireworks had a few explosive issues .
tonight we celebrated july 4th
of course there 's always lots of fireworks .
they put on a beautiful display
this one is one of my favorites
after the display was over i was off to get ice cream
the fourth of july . independence day .
we went to a fireworks show to celebrate location 's birthday .
the pyrotechnics were amazing . they really went for it this year .
the amount and variety of rockets was amazing .
and , of course , they had the big finish that had us all on our feet clapping and cheering .
celebrating the 4th of july with friends , the fireworks burst beautifully in the air .
every explosion of light causes a cheer in the crowd below .
the flashing lights in the sky are lighting up the earth below .
these fireworks represent what it means to be an american .
land of the free , happy birthday location !
the people were impressed by the fireworks .
there were many colors
and they were high in the sky .
they made cool colors
and went in many directions .
the town really outdid themselves this year on fireworks .
a heart shaped one..that was so cool . how do they make them like that ?
my wife 's favorite one ... she loves purple .
this one looked like they were going to land on us . great 3d effects .
one with a tail . it was really loud when the boom went off .
i love the 4th of july especially for the firework display .
the vivid colors .
the neat designs they can do , like this heart .
the loud booms and cracks .
everything about it just brings me to tears of joyful emotion about our freedom .
while watching the fireworks with our family , i saw a pretty blue and red one !
during the firework show one of them looked like a heart !
the next fireworks were pink ! my daughters favorite color !
they had a weird one that was red .
there even was a fizzy one that shot straight up and crackled !
i saw plenty of fireworks during my 4th of july weekend .
some of the fireworks were very creative in that they were able to form many different shapes .
the colors lit up the sky like a bomb going in different directions .
the flares they had made the dark sky look like a painter 's canvas if he drew lines on it with different colors .
i enjoyed seeing the finale where the flare made the sky so bright it looked amazing .
4th of july is my favorite time of year .
this firework looked like a heart , how do they do that ?
this had to be most beautiful firework all night .
this firework looked like a laser light show .
then the last firework to start the grand finale .
decorators were getting ready for the city fair .
they strung lights from building to building .
they had to fix the sign before people started arriving .
the entire city was prepared with neon lights .
there was even a dragon .
i went to the market last night .
it was very bright and colorful at night .
the shops were still open .
we had a great time walking around .
i went by a restaurant to grab some food .
it was sure to be a busy night on the strip .
all the vendors were expecting a big showing .
the neon lights were shining in all of there glory except the one which flickered continously .
lights were strung crossing the street between the buildings .
the haunted hut was also ready with its own theme for partying .
location town put in some new neon lights to highlight their buildings .
they still had the strings of lanterns to light up courtyards though .
some of the new lights were already busted .
others had both the lanterns and the lights and looked pretty fantastic .
there were some areas that had no lights so we stayed away from those areas .
location is so pretty at night .
there are so many different colors .
the neon lights add to the attraction .
how can anybody miss a storefront like this .
this attraction needed more lights then the storefront .
i 'm in the building looking down at a door wondering where this entrance will take me
right where i needed to be church well who would have thought that you detail so much from a symbol
this reminds me of distraction and despair look at the body of water and that artifacts that lay around it
look at the chains what do they remind you of could it be one of two things freedom by the possibility of freedom
now i 'm walking down this road i 've come across a building with an entrance where i did n't know i was going to church or ended up finding myself distraction despair and freedom
my dream since i was three years old was to go to location . this year , i finally did .
this bird looks like i felt when i got there -- -free and blessed .
the cars were so elegant all over town !
it was such a mix of old and new there . i loved the ruins , but i also loved the modern things .
i did n't like those foolish kids that graffitied all up the trains !
there were many beautiful churches .
stained glass art seemed to be the norm .
the trevi fountain was large and crowded .
there were many parts of the city that were forbidden for tourists .
in the evening , the city was empty .
our trip to location started out great when we found this statue .
we then saw this incredible window .
after walking a bit , we came upon our rental car .
we were able to drive to the coliseum .
we could not find our car , so we had to take the subway back to the hotel .
i started my sightseeing with a morning tour of the cathedral .
the stained glass was so intricate .
it was interesting to compare the beautiful , centuries-old art to the crumbling building facades .
the museum i 'd planned on attending was closed . there was a chain across the gate .
i decided to walk back to the hotel while enjoying the scenery .
what do you want to bet that this guy 's name is [male] ?
i would n't want to arm wrestle this guy .
it 's a [male] [male] prize doll .
even [male] [male] dolls look like they 've had too much work done .
so many [male] [male] dolls !
our coney island excursion starts with the famous [male] 's hot dogs .
the organization wheel was our next target .
from above the kiddie rides look like a playschool toyset .
while the people on the beach look like little bugs .
looking inward , the ferris wheel 's support struts have a geometric beauty of their own .
here we are on vacation with my sister and her husband .
look at the fun rides we will be enjoying right alongside the beach !
here is a better view of some of the rides . the kids loved it !
after we had a fun day riding rides , we went to the beach to relax and catch some sun .
this is one that i took while being on the ferris wheel , the middle of it .
the young couple is excited to see what is behind the wall .
they will fun taking in the sights from the organization organization .
everything looks so small from the top of the wheel .
the people at the beach seem so far away .
but they know they are safe in their personal caged in space .
we got to the carnival a little late and we just missed out `` the world famous [male] 's '' .
on to duel the world 's strongest man .
now to compete for the coveted [male] [male] doll .
we can feel mj looking into us , commanding us to take him home !
we did't quite cut it this time ... so long mj yee shall be missed .
a weekend at the location location pier is a great way to spend a summer day .
many visitors arrived early in the morning and the beach was crowded quickly .
[male] wished he had the day off , but he had to work at the burger restaurant that day .
[male] watched many of the beach goers in the water while serving customers their orders .
[male] 's manager let him go early , so [male] enjoyed a less crowded beach with his friends .
we followed route 66 all the way to the west coast and ended up in location location .
not sure what all the grave markers on the beach are for , but it made me a little uncomfortable .
location location location . we spent most of the day riding the rides and playing games .
next stop was dinner at this cute little burger joint . the food was good .
look at the parking lot ... not sure if we 'll be able to find our car .
we arrived at the beach .
there were thousands of people already there .
i saw a man wearing green near the concession stand .
a few brave people went into the cold water .
as the sun went down , we headed away from the beach .
we went to location location .
the beach was very crowded .
our son matched the bathrooms .
the water was very warm for that time of year .
it was evident many people drove to the beach .
i went to the location location beach today .
there were a lot of people at the beach due to it being summer .
i met up with a friend who was wearing a silly green shirt .
we mostly just talked about stuff while looking at the beach .
later on , we went our separate ways and drove home .
visiting the big city , my friend amed and i went for a drive .
the city was lit up with many sky scraper buildings . it was beautiful against the night sky .
the sky started to get a little overcast , and we worried rain might ruin our drive .
downtown , we saw a few theaters , and the traffic was very busy
we saw a majestic opera house to end the evening , just in time for intermission !
it was a pretty night on the city .
the clouds could be easily seen .
looks like everyone is out having fun .
the lights from the big buildings can be seen for miles .
this is the building where i work at , all lit up at night .
we had some flight delays so we landed in the evening .
which meant a spectacular drive into the city .
even after checking into our hotel the amount of people and cars still out and about was amazing .
i was n't sure if i wanted to go out in the bustle .
but i finally went out after saying to myself , `` how often are you in the city ? ''
sometimes we can feel like the tall buildings of the city are closing in on us .
but when we stand back we see each building has an individual character .
and we can always look up so see the open sky .
but it is now time to speed through the streets .
we can wonder how the little buildings feel when surrounded by such high ones .
such a beautiful busy city !
what a wonderful night sky !
those buildings look powerful !
the lights cheer up the night !
this place is amazing and bright !
it was a nice day outside , so we decided to visit the fair .
there were many good options for food , and we got burgers to eat .
it was very hot however , so guests needed to take time to cool down .
many people were enjoying themselves .
we made sure we stayed until night to enjoy the light show .
the fair had a huge turn out today .
these ladies been walking around all day and took a seat on the ground to rest .
the food look so good and tasty .
this food was delicious .
the night has ended and every one enjoyed their self .
yesterday we went to the fair .
we ate huge cheeseburgers and other fair food .
we had to lay down and relax our bodies were so filled with food .
the view was amazing though .
when the sun went down light performers took over the fair .
as we walked through the entrance we saw the ferris wheel .
before going on any rides , i ate some salty food .
i felt sick so i put a towel over my face .
the sight of the ferris wheel made me sick , so i moved as far away as i could .
by the time i was far enough away , it was night .
the park was filled with many attractions .
the park had loads of good food .
we were tired after the day 's festivities so some of us took a nap .
the park was crowded but still beautiful .
it was great to see the park lit up at night .
on vacation in location we decided to go to this park and it looked easy enough to find .
then we saw the next sign was n't in english and we were confused .
it turns out a lot of other people were lost too .
we found one more sign and figured we were going in the right direction even though we could n't read it .
when we got there we were the only people who made it .
some of the buildings were magnificent .
the inside of the buildings had great architecture .
the street lamps were beautiful .
we went to the church that day .
everyone went on the rides before they left .
i visited an amusement park near my hometown .
nearby was a patch of dirt and scrub brush .
the area had been done up to look like an ancient weathered town .
the roofs of the buildings were thatched .
in the center of the park was a made-up american town .
we had a busy day checking out the architecture of this city .
looking up , the brick detailing is interesting of this old post office .
outside we see the old lighting set up . these line the street to keep it lit up at night .
the church steeple in the background is traditional , and plays bells on every hour .
at the end of our tour of the architecture , we went to blow off some steam at the adventure park in the next town .
the church was inviting .
it 's architecture was interesting .
even the lamp poles interested our youngest children .
the tower of the church could be seen throughout the city .
to top it off , there was a ride located across the street from the church .
touring the architecture of the city was a favorite of mine .
we were able to go at our own pace .
when you look at the details of the building you appreciate how much time it took .
the clocks still work after all these years .
i have always wondered how they got the stones to make a slight curve on the buildings .
we grabbed a quick bite to eat before we explored the city .
an awesome statue of mercury was one of our first stops .
i was amazed at some of the artwork i had come across .
the insides of some of the buildings were beautiful as well .
to finish off the day we headed back to our hotel to enjoy the night .
the group went to see the old city .
they got to see the statue of mercury .
they also saw some old architecture .
as well as some greek style buildings .
the group had a great time seeing the city .
my husband is a big fan of greek mythology , so he was eager to see the famous mercury statue .
we had to view it from every angle possible .
i finally got him away from it , and saw the castle i 'd been longing to see .
he dragged me back later to the mythology museum .
i was quite glad at the end of the day to get to our quaint hotel .
the site-seeing tour consisted of several statues and landmarks .
this statue held particular appeal due to the unique pose that was displayed .
the historic building was beautiful .
a close-up of the building revealed unique art work .
the final stop was a building that was true to the area 's historical architecture , but was modern in build .
i thought we were in location . why is willy wonka here the ? haha .
saw a really cool bridge while sightseeing . could n't go on it though .
this building we stumbled upon really caught my eye . it mixes old with the new .
this has to be the coolest thing we have seen all day . reminds me of [female] in wonderland .
a tiny temple in the middle of a parking lot . i think i 've seen everything now .
we decided to go to location for a few weeks .
the coastline there is so pretty .
this bridge took us to the city we 're staying in .
they have such a beautiful sights there .
this is the hotel we wound up staying in for five nights .
a tour of location 's coastal sites .
the bridge is beautiful , the thick smog was not .
a picture of our hotel , small but luxurious .
the railway station was brightly decorated , building as art .
a small roadside shrine . reminds me of the one in spirited away .
that building in the distance looks inviting .
we must cross this spectacular bridge to get there .
the faÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ade of the building combines traditional with modern styles .
the paintings on the wall invite us to explore further .
finally we reach the traditional building which opens it arms to us .
this year we took a vacation overseas .
the sky stayed overcast nearly the whole time .
the sights were still awe inspiring .
the best part was the natural beauty of the land .
our hotel was one of the prettiest we had ever stayed in .
the street fireworks show was dangerous and dazzling at the same time .
one of the more daring people on the street the other night .
two men holding flares on a dare .
the crowd mulling around between explosions .
some fireworks to finish off the street show .
the 4th of july celebration was exciting .
everyone was lighting off fireworks .
the city even had a fireworks display .
all of the townspeople were having fun .
everyone enjoyed the 4th of july celebration .
the fireworks display downtown started off with flashes of sky flowers in the sky .
along the ground , people were playing with what looked like flares .
others had traditional fireworks .
they all grouped up together and lit the streets , making seem like we did n't need street lights that night .
the light really clashed with the fireworks above .
people were lighting fireworks in the city .
i got nervous as i saw someone close to em ready to shoot another one off .
my friend and i decided to use sparklers instead .
others had the same idea and the street became filled with smoke .
everyone decided to forget the sparklers and instead shoot some fireworks into the sky .
the celebration started in the streets .
people poured in from all over the city .
we got out flares and fireworks to have some fun .
it went a little crazy , but it was worth the finished product .
the fireworks we set off where amazing and everyone had a good night .
the fireworks were majestic .
the finale was majestic .
but it was hard to leave the park .
people were shooting off fireworks everywhere .

we were ready to leave , but more fireworks went off .
the police blocked the street , so we patiently waited .
as morning came , there was still smoke from the fireworks .
we hurried to the train station , but it was blocked off .
these fireworks light up the night sky .
these fireworks are very organized
these fireworks get bigger from left to right .
these fireworks are one huge explosion
they are outside making sure everyone is safe .
last night we went to an art show .
there were giant sculptures shaped like a jellyfish .
we even saw cubed art .
there was also abstract art that shined bright in the dark .
we ended the night with flower sculptures .
night time in location is perfect for art viewing .
with purple lanterns floating hauntingly above .
while led lit geometric griffins stalk the grounds .
and as one grooves to the psychedelic colors shining upon an art wall .
neon bright flowers spark over head .
i went to an art museum last weekend .
they had displays about light art .
i liked this paper tiger .
they had interactive displays .
lights lit up the night .
we arrived at the art show .
before we went in , we admired the giant pink sculpture .
as we walked towards the entrance , a red animal greeted us .
while inside we noticed people stuck to the wall .
it was dark and we were lost , but a neon bouquet led us in the right direction .
it was a colorful evening at the art museum .
there were bright pink jellyfish .
the gigantic red dog shone in the evening light
there was even performance art .
it looked like the lights of christmas , with a different undertone .

the play went over really well .
the fire works display went well after all the entertainment .
what a great ending to such a wonderful evening .

travelling abroad can give you a sense of adventure in architecture .
we decided to see the tower while visiting location . it has quite the reputation .
the clock tower stood erect against a nearly clear blue sky .
we traveled by boat to get a closer look at the tower , and the prison .
ultimately , or time had come to an end on this trek . worth it !
we had a great trip to location this year .

i took my little girls to the fair tonight and we aimed to win prizes .
then we went on the bumper cars .
i took her to a ball pit afterward .
then she wanted to go on the merry go round , so i took her there .
i ended the night with taking her on the ferris wheel .
ring toss at the jubilee is my favorite game .
she loved the bug car ride .
what child does n't love a germ-infested ball pit ?
mesmerized by the variety of balls in the machine .
although i like this picture , i am terrified of the ferris wheel .
we went to a large toy store in a theme park .
there was a drive-able little car for children .

you can grab something to eat at the indoor sushi bar .
i like to find a great seat to enjoy it all .
the trains come and go often so i find myself here a lot of times .
there was once a man and his wife that decided to explore a new city for the day .
they used the city map to explore places they had never visited before .
it was a beautiful day filled with lots of random performances , like a group of dancers in the park .
they gawked at all of the unique looking buildings that were scattered throughout the city .
to end the day , they a sushi dinner with there good school friend .
[female] and [male] decided to explore the town .
they checked the local map to decide their route .
the saw some performances along the way .
the attractions and artwork were breathtaking .
after a long day , the friendly barista made the couple a tasty drink !
many children can not predict train arrival times , as they can not read analog clocks .
they spend their time breakdancing at the mall instead .
and eating too many sweets .
which leads to a life of faux designer sunglasses and homelessness .
if only someone had provided a road map .
the clocks on the wall show the difference in time in various countries throughout the world .
there is a dance rehearsal going on in the park .
the shelves are stocked with local treats .
she is sitting down waiting for a train to arrive .
this map shows the routes that all the trains take .
we got to location location just as the sun was going down . that 's when it really comes to life .
the lights are bright . they must have a million light bulbs .
not to mention the amazing neon lights in every color .
and , well ... you never know what the lights will shine on .
we stayed out all night . now ... it 's time for breakfast . yum !
it was his first time in vegas and he decided to get in a little gambling .
the slot machines seemed to be lucky and calling his name out as a winner .
after a long night of gambling he took in the sights .
he was n't sure where he should go next .
sitting down for a buffet and recharging his energy was obviously the best answer .
they entered location location and could see the hotels and casinos .
they all had great displays .
the outsides were gorgeous too look at .
there was plenty to see in location location .
they ended the evening with a great meal .
location location is known as `` sin city ''
it has many casinos and other places to hang out .
some are tame .
others are exotic .
above anything else , the food is the best !
we had a great time gambling in location location .
we spent most of our time in the casinos .
we stayed at the location hotel .
finding our way around was confusing sometimes .
there was always plenty of good food to eat .
yesterday was quite a gloomy day .
no one was on the ferris wheel , and no one wanted to go out .
even the birds that i saw seemed gloomy and sad .
however flowers bloomed during the darkness .
soon enough , we could see the sky peek through again .
my plans to go to the newly opened amusement part were quickly dashed when the storm approached .
i had high hopes that the storm would quickly pass , but the large rain clouds next to our large tower told me different .
even the birds new that today was going to be rainy as they waited on the fence for the worms that would surely rise from the ground .
off in the distance i could again see storm clouds , but this time it looked much worse then before .
as i was making my way home i noticed a small break in the clouds , giving me the slight hope that it may pass soon .
a storm blew into my hometown this week , which caused the ferris wheel to be evacuated .
nearby , a tall church steeple stood against the clouds .
the birds braced themselves for what was to come .
the clouds rolled over the city , looking like an alien spaceship .
a small break ahead showed promise that we would be spared .
the sky was really overcast when we went to the amusement park .
we saw the ferris wheel looming in the sky as we approached .
the pigeons were the only occupants of the place since it was closed a few years ago .
the only color in the place were from the random sunflowers on the ground .
the clouds eventually broke and let in some sun but it was still a gloomy place to be .
i love taking landscape photos . there is something stark and beautiful about the storm clouds with the lone light pole in the air .
across the street i can see the ferris wheel , shut down due to the imprending storm .
these birds wait on top of the wall for the first raindrops to fall .
the flowers are open and ready to receive the rain .
as the first raindrops fall , the wind picks up . [female] storms are amazing .
my friends wanted me to go to this crazy concert .
the lead singer wore a mask and there was a robot on stage too .
the robot was even able to play this awesome guitar .
there were pyrotechnics by the drummer too .
people were even trying to stage dive by the end of it .
my friend took me to this concert . the musicians had the strangest costumes .
there was even a giant robotic guitar guy behind them .
i took lots of pictures of that crazy thing .
they all looked like the belonged in a zombie movie .
after the show we hung out in a local dive bar .
the guitarist was very personal with his audience .
he sang with a twang and a mask on .
the guitars were freakish instruments .
the lighting was a very intriguing chandelier .
we all gathered around to enjoy the music .
the singer points out into the excited audience at the concert .
the singer crouches down and begins to sing his number one hit .
the crowd is hypnotized by the flames on the musical equipment .
the lights shine on the stage and the band .
members of the audience begin to crowd surf in all the excitement .
guitarist pointing to the crowd .
guitarist plays a multi-neck guitar .
multi-neck guitar shown in the darkness .
the lead singer signals the drummer .
a fight broke out in the mosh pit .
today was a great day for a concert .
we decided to take the entire family .
everyone got dressed up for it in summer clothes .
everyone wanted to be in pictures .
it was fun to see a big organization vehicle while at the concert .
we went to the country fair today .
so many people were there having a good time .
they had many different things at the fair .
they even had a concert !
we had such a good time this year together !
i brought my girlfriend to the base yesterday .
i think she had a good time .
she brought her daughter with her .
i think she even made a few friends .
we got to ride in the army truck .
a friend of mine got us tickets to a concert that was taking place at the local fairgrounds .
we got there early because there was open seating .
we left one of our friends with our blanket and went to score some food .
even though it was pretty hot out the concert was great .
we had a great time dancing and enjoying the music together .
everyone is having a great time out here !
she looks cool in her hat !
we are enjoying ourselves out here !
we pose and look cool with shades on !
this is a beautiful army truck !
our first family vacation was really fun !
we rode a lot of rides in the carnival .
we especially liked this one since she likes dogs .
after that , we went for lunch in a train restaurant .
it was really cozy and interesting inside . we had a really good vacation .
the kids love this place .
they enjoy coming every weekend .
getting on the rides is great fun .
we also sit down and eat some meals .
after the day is over , we enjoy each other 's smiles .
today is family day .
we rode on carousals .
my husband is so good with his daughter .
then we visited a train museum .
it was nice to sit down and relax .
we all went to the amusement park today .
my oldest son even had fun .
here i am with my daughter on the merry-go-round .
we took an old train trip .
the train cars were surprisingly nice inside .
they pose for the camera because they are having fun !
they have fun on the merry go round !
they happily pose by the sad dog .
this building is a great place to be !
she is having a fun time .
[male] , [female] and [female] decided to attend sunday service at the local church .
they noticed the statue of the congregation 's idol , [male] .
gold painted cherubs looked down on the events , judging silently .
[male] saw the financial riches of the church , saw the homeless outside in the busy city , and felt restless .
as they left the church , [male] became enraged and mockingly fought with [female] . [female] rolled her eyes . just another day in our wacky family .
went to town to take a tour of a local church we are thinking of going to and hopefully get married in .
this church was founded in 1900.that is truly amazing that this church was made in a time with little of the modern technology as we have today .
there are beautiful statues and stain glass windows everywhere .
it was a very small church , but really well taken care of in the community .
the stain glass windows are amazing to look at and must be devastating to repair if ever broken .
i visited a church in my hometown to see what it was like .
there was a colorful statue of [male] inside .
the decorations near the ceiling were quite ornate .
i stood next to a stained glass window and contemplated the building .
outside , an old man was exiting with his daughters .
my local church has been with part of the town for years . this year , they wanted to do a little renovation .
they repainted the statue of [male] .
they re-gilded some of the decorative sculptures around the ceiling .
my friend was the one who was hired to do all this . he even got the stain glass windows cleaned to be more vibrant .
he also had to be a handy man at times , like the time he fixed the doorknob .
the old church had been around for centuries .
there were statues in need of repair .
there were also several parts of the building that needed updating .
the new groundskeeper would have his hands full .
he began with the entryway .
the pier is absolutely beautiful today .
i had a stroke of genius as i looked out at the ocean .
at first i wanted to just take selfies of me there .
but soon i picked up my camera and began to catch the light at dusk .
the light made the area even more beautiful than it was .
we love to go down to the pier .
they have many things to see and do .
it is always so pretty to see the water .
the sunsets there are just amazing !
we always have such a good time and end up taking many pictures !
yesterday we spent the day at the pier .
we played on the carosal .
and then went to watch the sun go down on the beach .
we had a great shot of the birds standing on the beach as the sun went down .
it was a beautiful sun filled day .
my friend and i visited the pier today .
we saw a lot of birds flying around the pier and above the water .
my friend posed for the camera with an object in her hand .
i caught a picture of one gull blocking out the sun .
the gulls looked fantastic illuminated against the darkening sky .
the amusement park is a great place to go .
the carousel was so much fun .
the view from here was just beautiful .
this sunset was so relaxing .
the birds liked watching it , too .
merry go rounds are the first stop every time we go to a fair or carnival .
then the kids head for more daring rides that make your tummy go to your toes .
tea cup rides are always the cutest.from a distance they look fancy .
when you get hungry , carnival food always taste good .
this is the view of the carnival from the other side as we head home .
one time i got to go to a awesome place that had rides for everyone ,
i saw pretty ponies and i had to wait till the ride ended before i could ride .
i picked the prettiest pony i had ever seen before !
mommy said i was to small to ride this ride and it made me mad .
so instead i rode inside of a tea cup . mommy said that it had real tea inside !
i got talked into going to the amusement park last week .
some of the rides were closed .
i took the opportunity to take pictures of them .
this ride looked fine but it scared me .
these types of rides are more my speed .
we got to the park and first we went on the carousel .
then we went on the big scary thing that shoots you straight up in the air .
we had to ride the tea cups .
we stopped and got some popcorn .
we stopped to take a beautiful picture of the water and scenery .
which is bluer , the sky or the ocean ?
the merry go round looks fun !
this horse looks elegant !
look at this fun ride !
the teacups look so gorgeous !
today was good day for the beach .
people was out sailing their boats .
there was an mini amusement park on the pier .
there was a live show there .
the day ended with some ice cream and then off to bed .
the old amusement park in our town is one of our favorite hang outs .
it may be small . but it has some great rides , including an amazing roller-coaster .
and it still has the little silly shows on stages , mainly for the kids .
and just outside the gates , there is rossi ice cream , some of the best ice cream around .
they also have a pretty cool lagoon area with rock cliffs and boats that you can rent and ride around in .

there were a lot of sports statues and things to see outside the field .
the field was the biggest i had ever been in and from our seats we could see the whole thing .
my sister seemed to be having a good time .
it was a great outing with family .
we headed down to the river front early so we could get a nice place to watch the fireworks .
we had a blast while we waited . it was nice to get caught up on each other 's lives .
the skyline was so beautiful .
these were the best fireworks i had ever seen . the show was great .

this family is celebrating the fourth of july by watching the fireworks .
the fire works come off in the water on a large platform .
at dark the fireworks start .
the fireworks are colorful and beautiful .
the last part of the fireworks is the best . the grand finale where they light off everything .
today my family and i joined during the day to celebrate fourth of july .
it was great to have the whole family together .
the sun began to go down .
the fireworks started in a burst of light .
they really outdid themselves on the fireworks this year .
getting the perfect spot to watch the fireworks was well worth getting there early .
having the whole gang there definitely made the wait a lot more bearable .
the beginning of the display was n't all that great .
but once things really got started , the display did n't disappoint .
the finale was especially amazing . overall , a pretty great 4th of july .
recently we went to see the fireworks . we arrived early in order to get the best seats .
while we waited , we passed time by taking pictures and playing random games .
as the light grew dim , we could tell the show was about to start . you could feel the excitement in the air .
look there ! it has begun ! they sure did start off with a bang .
look at the brilliant fireworks ! they come in so many amazing colors . this is definitely a night we will remember .
we all went out for a hike today .
we brought some stuff for a picnic .
our toddler had a great time .
we went for a short walk to the lake .
the view was breathtaking .
what a wonderful weekend . she got to ride a carousel .
we went to the lake . the water was very cool though .
we ate lunch at the park .
then we took a hike along the trails .
i carried the baby on my chest in a baby carrier , and he slept nearly the whole time .
this is my niece .
this is my nephew .
he looks silly in this hat .
i took my niece for a walk through the park .
we found a lake while hiking around .

this baby is enjoying the action !
he is all tuckered out !
what a great hike in the forest !
they have a great view of the ocean !
it was our daughter 's first ride on a merry-go-round .
we took our son to the park for a picnic .
he looks so adorable watching his sister play .
later , i took my daughter for a walk along the trail .
once we arrived at the lake , she wanted to go for a swim .
i went to the fair last week .
they had put up a ton of rides there .
it was in the middle of downtown .
there were many rides for kids .
they were very fun .
the city was holding a carnival .
they had inflatable slides .
as well as many different carnival rides .
it was mainly for kids , with small rides .
however , people of all ages attended and had a good time .
we tested the lights for the amusement park rides last night .
then we had the grand opening today . the rides were turned on and they worked wonderfully .
there were n't any lines yet in the morning but we hoped to get more later in the day .
they slowly started to trickle in and went to the kiddie area .
the car carousel was really popular with the younger kids .
the county fair is excellent at night .
[male] enjoyed the water slide .
this ride was a little too fast for [male] .
we got to pretend to be real race car drivers .
[male] made engine noises through out the ride .
a carnival has rolled into town !
[male] loves sharks and wants to ride the shark ride .
suzy likes to spin she wants to ride the spining ride .
[male] loves cars , he wants to go on the car ride .
and the kids run off in different directions , leaving the parents alone .
a family took a vacation to location .
the strip was surprisingly empty at night .
the signs looked beautiful at night .
a lot of tourists lined up to take a photo of the bridge .
they went to the organization organization organization store to buy souvenirs for their family and friends .
i love this place ! everytime we come it 's always a blast .
i can never get enough of the neon and art deco .
looks like a post card . ca n't believe there is no traffic .
oh yes , we 're going here tonight . it 's going to be so much fun .
they have a bridge in the club . this place just keeps getting better .
how excited we were we finally arrived at everything under the sun and spent some time there , we saw many exciting things .
afterward we took a nice , long walk on the town at night , all the beautiful lighting , such a sight to see .
we strolled along pass the gone location , the building was also lit up very beautifully .
the huge bridge we strolled by was very interesting to see , it was painted really nicely .
when we reached the world of disney , we were just totally outdone with all the lights , we knew we were in for the greatest treat of the entire night .
the sign lit up the entrance .
the buildings seemed to span for miles .
we made sure to stop inside .
the bridge looked very tall from the ground .
we stopped in the gift shop as well .
it was a beautiful location evening .
the streets were empty , but the lights lit up the town .
even without people , location looked glamorous .
there was a replica of the location location bridge .
of course , the trip would n't be complete without a souvenir from organization .
here 's us dirving to the ferris wheel .
this is a closeup of it . it was huge !
it was a long wait but it was well worth it .
the view from the ferris wheel was amazing !
here 's the eiffel tower .
i had always wanted to ride the ferris wheel at night .
as i approached the wheel i started to get nervous .
the nerves left soon though because i was taken in by the view .
watching the cars zip and zoom from up above is n't something you see everyday .
you are so high up that watching people seems like watching ants .
i love visiting the amusement park at night .
all of the rides are lit up and very colorful .
there is so much traffic to get there .
i hope we can get there before it closes .
i can see it from the road !
the ferris wheel was lit up beautifully for the evening .
the family waited on line for the ride .
from the top of the wheel , they could see the whole city .
they could even see the location location in the distance .
when the got off the ferris wheel , they walked towards the location location .
i conquered my fear of heights to ride the giant organization organization when we went to the big city .
at night , the wheel is simply amazing . i was glad i went on it .
the view of the gorgeous avenue through the city took my breath away .
the river was reflected in a million lights .
away in the distance , we saw the tower , all lit up . i kissed my husband and thanked him for the trip of a lifetime .
a great big statue in the middle of the street .
the same statue with pretty lights on it .
a beautiful ferris wheel with lights on it .
the iffel tower with a light on the top of it .
a beautiful way to end a trip .
we recently took a european vacation .
we got to see the ferries wheel in location .
it looked even better from afar .
we then headed to location to see the eiffel tower .
the city street were just beautiful on our last night there .
we were on vacation and we decided to go out one night to see the city .
we looked at some monuments at the city center
we then took a ride on the ferris wheel and observed the city .
we could see this tower from the top of the ferris wheel .
we then just walked along some streets that were beautifully lit on both sides .
going out at night is one of my favorite things .
it 's always so magical .
the kids love to ride the ferris wheel .
i love looking at all the sights .
the roads are so full of fun we never want to leave .
the lights of the city had always fascinated [male] .
they seemed to form a mysterious wonderland after dark , with a strange light connecting the white tree to the tower .
the organization organization reflected in the water made it look like there was an underwater wheel too , and [male] would pretend there really was .
the light shining off the tower into the sky looked like a path you could climb .
[male] would stand on the street , squint his eyes and pretend he was flying down a lighted tunnel . he was transformed by the night full of lights .
the city is full old old and traditional and traditional landmarks .
this was an old warehouse that once thrived .
this famous statue has rich history .
remnants of an old gas station stand here .
the ride has been a favorite for years .
there was once a city in really bad disrepair ever since the old factory shutdown .
the only committed residents seemed to be a family of cats that wandered the old abandoned buildings .
the citizens of the broken down neighborhood decided to clean their city starting with the old statue at the city center .
piece by piece the old was replaced with new , even the furniture within the abandoned buildings .
in no time the city was looking the best it ever was , and the citizens celebrated with a big festival to commemorate their hard work .
they took a trip to see the abandoned city .
everything in the city was abandoned .
even some of the famous statues that were there remain untouched .
all of the buildings were empty .
and the old carousel was left empty .
visiting our forgotten downtown .
the first tagging we have seen so far .
what a beautiful statue . wondering why they do n't move it .
abandoned chair . it 's so comfy !
yes , we found a location wheel . too bad we do n't know how to operate it .
the abandoned factory stands as a landmark for prosperous years gone by .
even the cats are homeless and hungry , hunting each other for food .
the great goddess 's statue stands frozen at the rich man 's estate .
he is not home ; the chair on his porch is abandoned .
he is off to the fair to play with his fortunate children .
we recently took a vacation to location ,
where we visited some gardens that were light with laterns .
we went right up to them to see how they looked up close .
the perimter of the gardens also had laterns all around .
near the lake there was a beautiful building that was light wonderfully as well .
the celebration of lights happens every year .
people purchase a light in memory of a loved one and put it in the display .
there are special lights for those that meant a lot to the city .
when it is all lit up it makes a beautiful picture of lights shining brightly .
the celebration of lights is a celebration of life .
the celebration was filled with candles .
every one of them was gorgeous .
some were set up in elaborate displays .
there whole sees of candles .
the group even made their own display .
the chinese festival wass spectacular .
every surface was laid out in light .
candles formed paths along the ground .
they led to the center of the festival area .
the highlight was seeing the pagoda lit up beautifully .
yesterday we say some really bright colors on the road while we were driving
we went close to what it was , it was a pattern of some sorts
someone light candles in shape of design
locals told me it was part of chinese new year
it was really gorgeous to see illuminated building at night
we recently went to a shopping center .
it was during the holiday season .
we overlooked the center lobby from the upper floor .
we then noticed the large christmas tree in the distance .
we then went up to the tree to see how nice it looked up close .
we decided to go to the mall during the holidays .
it was fun to people watch .
we enjoyed seeing the decorations .
the christmas tree was the best display .
but we had to stop and buy some chocolate before we left .
i have money in my pocket and gifts to buy .
i 'm so lucky we live near this awesome mall !
this address looks like so much fun .
i love this christmas tree display !
an up close view of the beautiful tree .
our trip to the mall at christmas time is always a chore , long lines and too many people always make me nervous .
but this time we got chosen for a lottery to be able to go into the mall for 4 hrs before they opened the doors for everyone else .
this is was so relaxing and exciting , see all the mall in it 's christmas decorations .
the tree was by far the best part .
this christmas will be the best ever .
location mall has decorated for christmas this year .
the mall offers a seating area for entertainment .
and a floating snow man for decoration .
a large christmas tree illuminates the center of the mall .
all the store fronts have been decorated for christmas too .
our trip to the restaurant was out of this world .
we parked in a non space shuttle spot .
these guys wanted to be our valets .
the menu is exciting .
it was the happiest day that week .
a popular fast food restaurant wanted to expand into a new country , and decided that to renovate an old building to test how successful they would be in a new market .
they cleaned up the building and the surrounding neighborhood .
then they created a menu that was unique to the cultural food of the country .
even adding new beverages that they felt would be popular in that country .
thanks to their tailoring to the needs and culture of the country they wanted to serve , the restaurant was a big hit , with line going out the building .
the family took a trip to an alien super market .
it had funny signs .
as well as fun displays .
their menu also had fun alien related options .
the family enjoyed the cookie pops .
we finally arrived at my favorite restaurant .
we parked at the aliens only sign which gave me the giggles .
next to the sign was a family of aliens who was visiting the restaurant too .
the wall plaque showed how far each planet was from alien fresh jerky .
inside the store was a rack full of smiley face candy .
today we went to a organization 's in another country . it was in location and it was in a small town .
the overall look and feel was very similar to one in here in the states . the signs and the buildings were very similar with only a few small differences .
the food was where the differences were most apparent . they served sushi rolls , fish , and a lot of rice dishes . something unheard of in the states .
though the containers looked similar to those here in location , they had cute little twists on them such as small umbrellas and exotic toppings on the food items .
the overall assembly line fashion of the organization 's overseas was almost identical to that here in the states , fast paced and hustle bustle .
we went on a road trip last weekend .
i was so excited .
we had a great view of the city from the top of the mountain .
there was a lookout point on the side of the road .
we took a lot of pictures .
they had a beautiful house .
they decided to go on a drive .
they went to the mountains .
there was snow in the hills .
it ended up being a great day .
today my sister and i are going on a road trip .
we met at her house and caught up .
then started our road journey .
we went very far up in the mountains .
and then posed for some pictures at a beautiful getaway resort .
we drove up to my parents cabin for the weekend .
my wife was extremely excited .
we saw the city on our way out .
we stopped by a coffee house to pick up my sister .
her friend also came along .
the white house was two stories tall but still small .
inside , two of the most interesting ladies in the world talked .
they also drove a very interesting car that was fast .
it was a bit cold outside and it had snowed .
they were both wearing warm gear and hats .
each year there is a fabulous fireworks display at location location on july 4th .
a variety if fireworks are used .
some are on the small size .
others are huge .
i love the colors and variety as it makes for a great show and a fun way to celebrate 4th of july .
we went to see the 4th of july fireworks last week in the city .
they were spectacular and had many different colors .
we especially enjoyed when they overlapped .
the grand finale was multiple strings of fireworks that kept going off .
it went on for almost 30 minutes until they were finished .
this year 's fourth of july fireworks display was magnificent !
it 's unusual to see a green starburst , because the chemical mixture required for it is difficult to perfect . but this company has a lot of expertise .
this timed detonation of a sequence of several different colors is a great example of their skill .
some of the starbursts seemed almost delicate , like dandelion puffballs .
i love this variety , in which several small , bright bursts follow the initial cascade of sparks . beautiful !
this year 's city fireworks show was amazing .
they had so many different kinds of fireworks .
there were some of the biggest i had ever seen .
the colors of some of them mixed beautifully .
it is definitely something we will go to again next year .
4th of july came with a wonderful fireworks display .
a green burst exploded and the crowd was amazed .
a blue burst ignited and everyone stood shocked .
a large yellow blaze reminded the crowd of the reason they were celebrating the holiday .
a raining rat-a-tat ended their gathering and scared some of the smaller children .
the city lit up the night sky
the city was so alive that night
people filled the city at night
and the towers stood high above the ground
the city had never shined brighter
this famous building is known for the many colors it can turn thanks to technology upgrades .
the purple is one of most attracting color to tourists .
sometimes according to the holiday it may change colors like easter for instance .
there are a few other buildings that have gotten great business because of this building .
they mark new beginnings for buildings that were not doing well financially .
i tried several different filters while photographing this building .
the purple filter was my favorite .
the multicolored one was too busy .
here 's a fisheye picture that i took .
there are more than enough buildings to take pictures of .
our vacation this year was in a big city and we decided to look at architecture at night .
while we were walking , we came across this awesome building .
and in this shot you can see how cool this building really is .
we walked for about an hour and this is a shot of the park we found .
this is another shot of the first building . this is the end of our walk around the city .
this building looks so large !
this place is lit up so beutifully !
what an amazing sight this building is !
these buildings are so tall and breathtaking !
what a wonderful sight this building is !
[male] wanted to ride the carosel .
[female] road the little boat .
[female] , [male] , and their mommy walked through the park .
the balloon man made [female] a balloon .
they all had a great day .
[female] went to the fair and rode the carousel and
the planes
and watched the balloon man make her a puppy dog out of four different colored balloons .
he took his time to make sure it was just right for little [female] .
she was so happy .
we took our kids to their first fair . they loved the carousel .
they also loved the swings that looked like airplanes .
my daughter wanted a balloon animal .
the man tried his best to make the little mermaid for her .
it was not successful in my opinion .
my son wanted to ride a giraffe .
she wanted to ride a blue airplace

she is getting a balloon animal .
what a fun day at the carnival !
time for some merri go round fun !
she has a blast in the blue boat !

we were very excited to be going to the art show .
there were a ton of amazing pieces from various eclectic artists .
the colors danced across the pieces drawing us into them .
we were entranced by the bright light show on the outside of the museum .
it was a truly one of a kind experience , we ca n't wait to go back next year .
the church was having a light show .
the magnificent colors filled up the church in a mystic blue and red light .
this light show is one to remember for years to come .
this light show even showed flowers on the wall .
and blue horses it was an amazing show put on by the church .
the light installation was very interesting . some had very interesting shadows .
others were just the way filters were used to produce different effects .
the biggest installation was the one for the church , lighting up different sections with different colors .
across the street , they threw up designs on the side of the buildings .
one was an image created using nothing but text .
this building is just gorgeous !
the colors shown here are more vibrant in person .
the architecture and lighting here was mind boggling .
these remind me of lighted flowers which make me happy .
the was eerily fascinating and i could n't stop looking at it .
this visit to the art museum with my wife was very interesting and fun . we loved the lighted effects of this abstract sculpture .
this photo is not really our style , but very funny !
wow , look at the building lit up outside . the building is dazzling inside and out .
across the street the library is lit up from the dancing lights as well .
we had a great evening out . we saw this piece on the way out . it was one to make us think . now we are off to dinner !
we entered the park with our dog .
then we made sure to check the signs .
we walked under the arch .
the dogs had a place to rest .
the arch is were we are heading .
our first vacation as a family , we took the kids to a park in location .
these signs were so cool , [female] looked at them for 20 minutes .
this man brought his beautiful dog to the park- [female] petted him a few times .
the big arch near the parks theater . it was huge !
[female] posed with the big easter bunny statue , she thought it was cool .
this little girl brought her dog to the park .
there were many people displaying signs outside .
altogether , the park was filled with life .
pets and people all paced the park together .
the coolest object was the semi dome at the end of the trail .
we attended the great cultural fair today , and my daughter found this tiny dog .
she looked at the history and stories of the city and citizens .
the arch represents this town 's greatest achievement .
we took a break next to this fellow and his dog .
we ended our day waiting for a pageant to be setup on stage . looks like it should be fun !
people were walking their dogs at the festival in the city .
other people had made signs protesting the government 's policies .
i think grandma had a good time , even though it was pretty sunny .
there were lots of dogs out with their owners enjoying the sun .
this area was off limits though , the dogs were not allowed to cool off in the fountain .
it was a great day in japan the sun shined bright
the place was filled with so much history
not a cloud was in the sky
the ancient japanese buildings stood tall
it was a great day to visit japan
i love all the different types of oriental buildings .
they look so majestic and pretty .
there is so much history behind every building .
many people visit them each year .
i hope one day i can see all these places for myself !
location is a beautiful continent .
we toured around location this summer .
i love how red and beautiful the trees are .
the tall buildings are awesome .
i did not want to leave .
we went to pagota ville .
the entrance to the park was really pretty .
we caught the fall leaves at just the right time .
how did they build it so high ?
tourist shop..yep..they sold mini pagota 's !
the architecture in location is amazing .
i especially liked the roofs .
they use tiles instead of shingles .
i was n't the only tourist there .
this building has five roofs .
this plane was one of several transportation pieces we saw .
a closer look put us in awe .
the train station is another great site .
the cars are bright and shiny .
it is one incredible icon of modern transportation .
the family was going to see planes and trains on their vacation because their two boys loved them .
the first stop was the local airport where they saw lots of planes .
they also got to ride on a nearby ferris wheel .
they took a walk down the street and looked at different plays showing .
and finally that night they got to see and take a ride on a train .
my husband loved exploring this vintage plane !
we got up close and personal with the plane on our tour .
we followed the signage to the trains !
we enjoyed the uniquely designed trains .
the marvelous trains were great to see on our vacation .
the family came with me to the air center to see the sights .
the planes were really big , much bigger then we expected .
we road the ferris wheel to get a birds eye view of the area .
we took in a show in the afternoon that was funny and entertaining .
we hurried to see all the sights as darkness fell .
we took a few trips this summer . first one was to the place graveyard .
the graveyard had a lot of neat planes that no longer run .
we took our next trip to the trains !
the trains all looked neat , but it was getting a bit late .
we decided to wrap up our first day with these amazing trains !
the mother of the family is cooking lots of food for the family reunion .
everyone arrives and they look hungry .
they sit down to eat and talk while the kids eat in the other room .
after dinner they go to see the local christmas decorations .
they get to see a smiling snowman while they wait to see location . it was a good night .
christmas is always special in our family .
we always get out and look at the lights .
the children love the over sized location display .
the best part is when everyone can get together .
the food is always better when prepared for those you love .
christmas time at our house is magical .
everyone puts out amazing decorations .
the whole neighborhood gets involved with the holiday decorating .
our family getting ready to sit down for christmas dinner .
it 's always a fun time when we get together !
our mom invited family over for a special holiday dinner and spent a while cooking .
we piled onto the couch to chat and catch up .
afterwards , we ate supper at the table .
we all then decided to go outside and see the christmas display dad had put up .
we especially liked the snowman !
here is the mother of this family slaving away at the stove for christmas dinner .
and here mom joined the rest of the family for a family picture before sitting down to dinner .
dining room was n't big enough for the entire family , so some sat here and others sat in the family room .
family went for a walk to see the street lights at all the neighbors ' houses . this was one of the favorites .
and here was a friendly snowman greeting everyone who walked by .
we took a trip to a place where they light up colored cloth objects .
they had dragon ones that were really cool .
this dragon one was our facorite one .
we also found the turtle that was hiding from us very amusing .
our last stop was to see a cool guy in a little wagon train , it was so colorful .
it is time for the new year 's parade . the only prediction is that their should be a lot of dragon floats .
dragons are a symbol of good luck and a sign of a good year .
what better way to celebrate the new year then in location location .
this turtle is cute , but it likes to hide it 's eyes .
this is my favorite float of the whole parade and a very fitting end for a great night .
we went to go see the decorations that are going to be in the parade .
it will be at night so they are lit from the insside .
some of them are so very creative , like giant dragons !
my personal favorite was a turtle that seemed shy .
i think the outside material was silk . everything was very asian .
i went to see a play when i was in location last summer .
it was very colorful and lively . at one point there was a large singing dragon .
the dragon then danced around the staged and everyone laughed .
a turtle played hide and seek with the other characters .
finally a boy rode in a carriage while the other characters sang .
the parade of floats we my favorite time of year .
the kids really enjoyed the dragon one , with its bright flaming colors .
the year dragon floats were in large supply .
my turtle one got the largest applause . it was so cute .
my favorite was the little boy driving the cups . this reminded me of my little [male] .
the family went to see the amazing stained glass display .
there was a beautiful blue sky scene .
another scene had a man with a tree growing out of him .
there were some very interesting scenes .
the best scene was the fire scene .
we got to go to the new light up room display while we had the day off .
there was so much to see in all of the details .
the colors were vibrant and made you want to keep looking at it .
the glass work is an artwork not to be taken for granted .
this was a great experience to be able to share with the family .
the ceiling at the exhibit was breathtaking .
each segment was unique and beautiful .
from afar it looked like a blend of colors .
with a closer look , everyone could see the amazing detail .
the artwork was absolutely amazing !
last month i visited the colored glass building downtown to see what it is all about .
it was amazing inside !
there was so much art and color .
i got a little dizzy being inside of the building .
there was too much for me to look at but i am glad i went and saw it .
the children went to see a light show for a field trip .
first the ceiling lit up neon blue .
followed by the image of a man flying across the ceiling .
as the man flew across the ceiling , he came to the sun .
the sun turned into a giant fire breathing dragon .
the fireworks show looked great over the city .
there were many colors and designs .
they could viewed from many spots in town .
some of the best were also the tallest .
so many patterns were made that evening .
it is the fourth of july and our city is known for having the best fireworks display .
we have the best spot to sit and see the fireworks . the red ones are my favorites .
some people like to watch the fireworks from the rooftops .
no matter where you are sitting it is always a good view .
it looks like it is finally time for the grand finale .
they watched the fireworks from a rooftop in the city .
the fireworks were overlapping but still looked spectacular .
the purple fireworks were definitely the best .
but everyone loved it when they all went off at once .
the finale was spectacular and everyone loved watching the fireworks .
4th of july in my fair city !
the firework display is awesome !
look how far the display is away .
getting near the finally of the show .
i love this year 's display .
we just made it downtown for the start of the fireworks .
the sky was lit up with red fireworks .
we made our way around but our new location was not as good as our first location .
finally we found the best spot of the night .
the finale was everyone 's favorite part .
[male] and [female] decided to do some sight seeing . the organization organization seemed a great place to start .
later they got a snack and took in the capital building from a distance .
[male] and [female] visited with their friend [female] , while sight seeing downtown .
later they all went to the top of a lookout , and took amazing photos of the sunset .
[male] felt it had been a good day .
a couple decided to go sight seeing in the city and see many tourist attractions .
the city looked extremely beautiful .
they took a photo in front of the bridge .
the sun was beginning to set .
they went on the ferris wheel during the sunset .
we had our first date in location .
we climbed on top of buildings and watched as life happened below us .
we paused to take pictures to remember the moment .
the sun began to go down , best sunset of my life .
to end the night he took me to the fair .
we recreated our first date . it began at the ferris wheel .
we then had lunch with a view of congress in the background .
we then took a tour of a modern installation .
we ended with dinner at the roof of a hotel .
we watched the sun set with drinks .
i met my date at the ferris wheel .
we chatted for a bit over coffee at a restaurant with a great view of the city .
we decided it might be fun to ride the ferris wheel .
the sunset was beautiful from the top of the ride .
overall , i think the date went really well . i 'd like to go out with him again .
we went down to the beach to watch the fireworks .
everyone was so excited to see the show and we were n't dispointed
the sky was lit up with all different colors .
by the end it was pretty much every color in the rainbow .
the end was spectacular and we have all clapped with applause .
i had a great time at the fireworks show last weekend .
there were a ton of colorful fireworks .
many of them were very loud .
some of them were quiet .
i took a lot of pictures .
the firework show started off slowly
after it kicked off it light up the sky .
their were many different colors , and hues .
like magenta , and purple .
the big finale near the end was very exciting .
[female] watched a fireworks display that reminded her of the constellations above .
the yellow bursts on a red background reminder her of her own galaxy 's sun .
the bursting red bloom reminded her of location .
a purple raining explosion made her think of asteroids encircling other planets .
a final combined bust of color reminded her of how complex and beautiful existence was .
the fireworks display began modestly .
just when the audience was growing a little restless , a surprising flash exploded in the sky .
the fireworks grew larger and filled the sky .
the audience was enraptured and gave out sighs of awe .
the grand finale reduced grown men to tears with its beauty .
my children has a good time on the swing .
they played a lot of the mini games .
there were so many prizes too win and i wanted all of them .
this man went after my boy and won him a bear .
the last thing we rode was this ride at the fair .
today we took all the kids to a carnival that was in town .
the kids rode the swing ride while we watched from below .
then the whole family took a ride in the giant ferris wheel .
i won a pair of not so amused looking lizards at one of the games . who knew anyone won those things .
the kids were pooped and bummed to leave , but we are coming back next week !
the fair was so much fun for the kids !
he hit it !
the prize he picked for winning the game !
look we found [male] !
our last stop before leaving the fair !
[male] really enjoyed going to the fair . he rode the swings .
he played some games .
he even won a stuffed gator .
but , when he asked his friend to join him on the ferris wheel , his friend turned him down .
so , he skipped his favorite ride .
our family went to a local carnival last weekend .
they had a large set of flying swings .
they also had a organization organization .
there were games where you could win prizes .
the carnival had many families and young kids .
americans make poor dietary choices .
this soda fountain pumps thousands of gallons per day .
even our wildlife is addicted to junk food .
locally grown produce hardly even gets unloaded from the truck .
we seek comfort in foods such as ice cream .
i went to see the bridge last week .
there was a tram nearby .
i decided to go to the amusement park .
there were many attractions there .
i really enjoyed all of the decorations .
burgers and fries for lunch before heading out to disneyland .
the first place we took the kids was the bug 's life section . everything was huge .
we even saw some of the characters cleverly hidden in the grasses .
there were random fruit stands on the back of trucks there too .
we managed to get ice cream at one of them .
burgers and fries for breakfast ! a hearty way to start the day .
and certainly in keeping with the oersized playground i was taking my son to .
oh god what 's tha- ... uhm , nevermind . i totally did not get scared by a fixture looming in the vegetation at playland .
on our way out , we saw one of the trucks delivering more supplies to the grounds .
we finished our sunday with a sundae get it ? it had a cherry on top . i love dad jokes . my boy , not so much .
the food at the amusement park is so good .
i like seeing all the unusual attractions .
some of them are n't obvious .
here we see a hillbilly truck .
ca n't leave the park without eating some junk food .
location location is a fun place to visit .
the statues are real looking and you feel like you are in location .
the fake sky seems real .
a cheesecake factory is a good to eat .
the wheel is interesting to look at .
a couple went out to the city to have a date night .
while they were walking , they came across many sculptures .
they decided on the cheesecake factory for dinner .
afterwards , they continued to walk around and saw more sculptures and fountains .
they finished off the date by riding the ferris wheel .
we began our lovely date with a trip to the museum .
we luxriated in the presence of artful sculptures , sharing in beauty that had been known for centuries .
after too much time spent being pretentious , we took a walk .
we made it in time for our reservation at the cheesecake factory , where we are entirely too much fattening food that 's going to kill us .
we concluded our date with a romantic trip on the ferris wheel . well , i thought it was romantic , anyways . my date did n't like it as much given that we it got stuck . it took them three hours to unlock us . she had to pee .
what a sky !
i smell french fries !
we like cheesecake !
so many things to do indoors !
we will be back next year !
our hotel was designed to look like ancient location .
there were many statues in the main lobby going towards the casino .
the ceiling looked so much like the sky , i almost forgot that we were indoors .
the restaurant had good entrees and my red velvet cheesecake was delicious .
it was a shame that we could n't ride the ferris wheel . it would have been fun .
we went to the outdoor concert yesterday .
there were many people there .
we took a lot of pictures .
the band played great .
the drummer was very good .
the small gathering of musicians was under tents .
this bad sang covers .
they were good at dancing and singing .
he had an encore because his voice memorized everyone .
the dress code was anything you want .
the stage was getting prepped for the next band , but some of them were running late .
knowing that he 's late the lead singer hurried to the stage on his over-sized tricycle .
the crowd was growing impatient and some of the children were getting ready to leave .
the drummer was the only member on time . so he decided to rock a drum solo to keep the crowd excited .
during the solo , he noticed his other band members arriving on the giant bike , and called them to stage to start playing .
i went to see a band this weekend .
they had an interesting parking lot shuttle .
i made the kids wear ear protection .
this is my favorite member of the band .
he played really well .
a large crowd had gathered for the planned concert .
nearby , an art display made a welcome diversion during the wait .
some of the younger crowd members started to get restless .
the band finally took stage and began to sound check .
after a brief practice period , the band dove right in to their set .
at hybrid wonderland the robots are the best part .
they can do almost anything .
they can look mad ...
and play jazz
and do it with class .
[female] and friends head to japan to see a futuristic robot .
arriving in the city they snap this beautiful picture of the sea .
once inside they snap a photo of this amazing robot .
they are really amazed by all it can do .
the robot eve starts to play a musical instrument and everyone is impressed .
this is where i plan to spend my day .
this guy seems like he could be a great tour guide , do n't you think ?
he seems to be interested in what we want to do .
he is now entertaining us with blues music .
he did pretty , well , too , if i do say so myself !
we went to hybrid wonderland for our vacation .
here you can see the robot ayumi .
this is a close-up of ayumi 's face .
she can do many things even play trumpet .
she is a very talented trumpet player .
there was a big sign
with a robot .
the robot could move
and play music
and light up .
i love roller coasters a lot . they give me such a thrill when i ride them .
the higher they go and the more turns there are , the more excited i get .
from up here in the swings , the coasters do n't look as big as they are down on the ground .
the swings up here in the sky scare me worse then the roller coasters .
what i always hated about the fairs , were when the ferris wheels would stop with out bucket at the very tip top .
this is an amusement park for families and friends to come and ride rides .
this park has a roller coaster that covers the whole park .
the park has other rides that are not roller coasters .
there is a ferris wheel and other calmer rides for the families to enjoy at the park .
there is a water park where you can relax on hot days or go on water rides .
the line for the rollercoaster was long .
it was a new one with some crazy loops .
you had to walk up a flight of stairs to get to it .
on the way up , you could see the ferris wheel .
we decided to ride on the swings instead because the line was so long .
the group decided to ride the largest roller coaster .
the first large hill gave a bird 's eye view of the park .
as the coaster dove they veered hard to the left .
another rising climb showed the remainder of the coaster ride .
their journey ended in front of the ferris wheel .
our family spent the day at the amusement park .
the kids were excited to ride the roller coasters .
there were so many rides to choose from .
i wanted to get on a less scary ride like the ferris wheel .
at the end of the day , the kids and i rode on the spinning swings .
a beautiful view of the mountains we will be by .
we are getting ready for some adventure .
a beautiful view as the sun is about to set .
getting ready for the night of sleep .
one last view of the mountains before we left .
i have been working on my photography skills .
it is important to build my portfolio with examples of bright pictures .
i love to capture shots of the sunset .
this shot was taken while i was laying down .
it 's not everyday that you have so many opportunities to find great shots in one place .
we had to walk all the way to that mountain .
i brought my sunglasses so i could protect my eyes while i went on this journey .
we came across two lone palm trees on the way to the mountain .
we decided to stop and play on a swing set because it was getting dark .
in the morning we woke up and saw that we had been going the wrong way and the mountain was now even further away .
the person picked out the perfect vacation , beginning with a snowy hike .
next they would ride the ferris wheel .
then go to a beach for a bit .
after that they would look at pictures from the earlier hike .
and finally camp in a tent .
one of my favorite vacation spots provides this breathtaking view of the mountains .
i am always so happy and content while i am travelling .
watching the sun set as the palm trees sway in the breeze is always so relaxing .
there is no better way to end the day than to have a swing as the sun goes down .
even in the snowy mountains i can escape and enjoy myself .
on our trip we decided to visit a local meditation garden .
the plants and stained glass were very calming and refreshing .
it is amazing that people can make such beautiful displays of art .
this one is especially awe inspiring .
but i think the favorite one of my entire vacation is this stained glass ceiling display .
i decided to go to the decorative gardens .
because i wanted to see the plants .
i walked down the pathways .
i saw lots of neat statues .
but my favorite was the stained glass windows .
the stained glass ceiling of the greenhouse was absolutely mesmerizing .
there was an array of exotics plants to look at and the different scents brought all of my senses alive .
the cobblestone walking enhanced the beauty of the flora .
this gorgeous statue and plaque accented the flora nicely .
as the sun was setting the stained glass windows looked as if they were coming alive .
i took a trip to the local indoor garden .
there were many plants of all shapes and sizes .
the colored glass made for some amazing sights .
the architecture they used really complimented both the garden and the glass enclosure .
as night and it became time to leave i took one last look at the beautiful art surrounding me .
our trip to the greenhouse was eye opening .
we were jealous of all of the large greenery .
we followed the path to get a better view of the stained glass windows .
the stained glass window seemed to glow in the sunlight .
although we came to see the plants , the stained glass windows will keep us coming back .
we were up at a hilltop overlook .
they had a ferris where that we rode on .
i took a picture of my wife on the stairs overlooking the view .
there was also a cool looking tower in teh distance .
we really enjoyed looking over the tree covered hillside .
we are visiting location for the first time . i am excited to take in all of the sites , especially some historic cathedrals .
we are leaving time for play at a local amusement park .
this is me on the roof overlooking the city .
is n't it beautiful ? i just love the sites .
after the city we decide to explore the countryside .
my husband and i went on a vacation in the mountains last year .
there was a huge ferris wheel near our hotel .
my husband stopped to take a photograph on the bridge we walked on every day .
from our hotel room we could see the top of the tallest tower in the mountains .
and from the other window in our hotel room we had a great view of the mountains .
the fair took place in the shadow of a dramatic castie .
the ferris wheel gave access to the sites of the valley .
from the ferris wheel one could look over the roofs of the village .
one could see farther still over the entire town .
on the opposite side , one could see from the ferris wheel the green hills and mountains in the distance .
this is the view at the entrance to the amusement park when we went .
the ferris wheel is our first stop when we go .
we went down to the separate area . it 's quite a long walk .
there are more rides , tents , and activities at the bottom area .
then we left so we could see the beautiful nature outside of the park .
one day a little girl was looking out her window .
she saw some construction equipment .
they started to put up some wiring .
it began to wind up into a neat structure .
when it was done she could n't believe how interesting it was !
i enjoyed touring the city with so much detail .
the vibrant colors on the balcony draw your eyes upwards .
the purple is a unique choice for the outer exterior .
some of the details were not meant for practical uses .
they took a long time to construct the artworks .
the little girl looked out the window .
she saw the craned as they covered the tower .
since it was not sturdy , barbed wire was needed .
the wire was wrapped around the tower to prevent people from trying to climb .
the tower should be well protected so that nobody comes to harm .
[female] looked about at all the constructing going on for the new stadium .
she imagined that the two lifts were dragons in a fierce battle .
the razor wire was a pile of snakes .
she thought the staircase was alive .
[female] liked playing this game , she would do so everyday until the stadium was complete .
i went to location to take photographs for school last week , i brought my daughter along with me .
the first photograph i took was of two big , abandoned cranes
my favorite photograph i took was of barbed wire .
i noticed this awesome roller coaster near the towns center .
it 's still under construction , but it will be huge when it 's done .
we are visiting the carnival for the day . we need to make sure not to get lost in this crowd .
the first stop we make is obviously for the food . is it a good idea to get stuffed right before going on rides ?
well , i guess it 's too late for that now . the roller coaster is the first ride we decide to go onto .
we spend the day jumping from ride to ride and getting really dizzy .
it 's time to go home , but i guess we have enough time to catch one last ride .
the family decided to go to the amusement park .
the girls wanted to go on a ride .
our boy wanted to ride alone .
the kids then dared the adults to go on a ride .
it was a very packed park .
we had a great day at the amusement park .
first we were a bit hungry , so we had a guy carve some food off for us .
then we went to ride a rollercoaster , which was great fun .
it was a busy day , there were a lot of people there .
we capped off the day with a ride on the swingy boat .
we went to the amusement park the other day . there were tons of people .
everyone took turns on the rides .
they were a lot of fun .
the whole family went with us .
we had a great day at the amusement park , but it was getting too busy for us and we decided to leave .
we decided to take the family to the amusement part today .
the girls liked the boat ride .
their brother even hopped on for a ride .
we all enjoyed the roller coaster .
even though it was crowded , we had a great time .
this is jonco and i . we decided today that we would meet some new people in our town .
our first couple we met were su and [male] . they were brother and sister . they love to take walks together every morning . they were a close pair .
this is [female] and location . they are conjoined twins , attached at the hip . they look posed but they actually have to stand this way because they were born attached to each other . what a fun pair !
this is rob . we met him just down the street . he would n't let us photograph his waist down because he has the body of a frog and it embarrasses him . he did n't talk much .
our final man we happened upon in the park is paulo . he was a russian spy ! 2 seconds after this photo was taken he had us both on the ground with our feet tied behind our backs ! ! we were heavily beaten and eventually passed out . we never saw him again .
my college friend came to visit me in my new city .
of course we had to do the touristy things like go to the zoo and look at the animal .
we also looked at the tourists .
here is a photo of us not going on one of the worlds scariest coasters .
once the sun went down there were other spots to visit .
during our trip there we saw street performers .
we met very neat people .
these people became our guides and best friends .
we did a lot of hiking outside .
it was autumn and chilly . time to go home .
the city is exciting year round .
in the colder months , people bundle up to watch outdoor performances .
in the spring , the greenhouse opens up for people to explore as well .
in the fall , it is common to see students walking around the college campus .
the parks are also a common gathering location year round .
there was once a man that decided he wanted to explore the city with an old friend .
they visited the museum first and saw funny looking outdoor sculptures .
then they visited the park where they found other tourists taking pictures .
next they went downtown and looked at all the tall buildings and unique statues .
they ended their tour at the famous eiffel tower .
i took a evening trip down to the beach .
i got to see very many seaguls while i was there .
this one let me get very close to him .
i then noticed how many birds were around the ferris wheel .
here you can see how many of them are sitting on a ferris wheel cab and the adjoining strucutre .
every morning i watch the gulls as they land on the sea shore in search of food .
sea gulls can be very loud creatures , but in the early morning they seem to be a little more quiet .
i love watching as they fly over the abandoned amusement park .
the ferris wheel is usually a good resting place before they take off for the day .
i love watching the beach in the early morning . it helps relax me before i start my day .
i woke up early one day and went out for a jog along the pier .
i saw some lone sea birds digging for insects .
i jogged passed the ferris wheel that was closed at the time .
there were tons of birds on it .
the street lights were still on because it was so early .
the trip to the beach was filled with the sights and sounds of birds .
in and out of the water the birds were all over .
this bird seemed like it was enjoying the cool water on it 's feet .
the birds even took over the ferris wheel .
it was fun to see so much wildlife in a place that is usally filled with people .
this is going to be a series of pictures of birds . these birds flock to the shorelines in and sometimes display murmurations in the sky .
here one bird out of the many is taking solace in the water .
here is another closeup of the same bird showing its reflection in the water .
this was a cool photo of the birds beginning to form a murmuration behind the ferris wheel .
some birds defected from the flocks to rest on one of the ferris wheel 's cages .
a family with a yellow man .
a boy in a lego car .
a person in a lego train .
a boy on a fake pony .
a boy with a big creature .
there was once a small family that decided to celebrate their youngest son 's birthday by spending the day at an amusement park .
he was so excited to spend the day having fun he had a grin on his face from ear to ear .
his dad even took him on a couple of roller coaster rides .
the birthday boy and his brother even watched a parade pass by .
he ended the day with by taking a wacky photo .
we went to lego land and posed with a yellow lego man at the entrance .
[male] rode a blue lego car enthusiastically .
we also all took a ride on the lego train .
then [male] and [male] took turns on the jousting horse .
there were a lot of lego sculptures around the park that the boys posed in front of .
lego land was going to be so much fun . the boys have been excited all week .
toms first thing was to drive the lego cars .
and jacks was to ride the train , how he loved trains .
then [male] acted like a knight on top of the metal horse .
after seeing the largest robot ever , it was time to leave . bye lego land .
the family spent the day at the amusement park .
the older son loved the water games .
the dad loved the falling ride .
the children looked at some of the decorations .
the children 's favorite decorations were the holiday ones .
we went down to the park to see the rides at night .
everything looked so cool at night , even the plain bridge in the way over .
we just could n't believe how cool the ferris wheel looked .
we saw the statue on our way as well .
our last photo we took was from the ferris wheel and the view we saw .
the arc of the bridge offered a rainbow-like sign of hope .
he took the ferry across the harbor to meet her at the fair .
the lights from the fair were enticing .
she had agreed to meet him under the ferris wheel .
when he got there , however , she was nowhere to be found .
on a cool fall night a organization wheel continues to turn in the distance .
in the distance a metro train passes over a bridge .
the reflection of the lights on the ferris wheel reflect on the surface of the water .
we stop to gaze at a local landmark statue .
we end are fall night with a treat of an ice cold coca-cola as we walk off into the distance .
we headed off to the fair .
we set out and realized this was going to be harder then we thought .
we had to take the long way around the bay .
we got to see some cool stuff though .
it was worth it when we finally arrived .
the city is very lovely with its architectural bridges and unique buildings .
a great way to view the city is in the evening on a boat trip .
see the way the pier and boardwalk lights up in the dusk ?
the ferris-wheel is lit up and beautiful this time of evening . it is probably full of people viewing the city from above .
notice the one of the statues that are scattered through the city . it is details like this that add to the wonder of the moment .
we went to a political rally in location location .
there were tons of people there who had camped out for days .
the media that covered the story set up near by with chairs .
this man was very vocal about the cause .
after three days , the mayor 's aid showed up and made a short speech .
we all gathered on this gloomy day to protest .
fairness in voting is something that needs attention , so it was up to us to raise awareness .
we even brought the children along to see us in action .
there were plenty of bloggers and reporters there to report as the story unfolded .
as the day wore down , we were unsure of our progress .
it was a fair votes now rally .
many other types of protesters came though and they all camped outside with us .
some brought along their laptops and blogged .
we had veterans joining us .
and on the other end of the spectrum , rich people too .
the protesters marched down the road with their signs held high .
after a few cycles around the road , they decided to join together and rest out front of a government building .
they began researching more information on the cause with their laptops and discussed how their protest was going .
one member brought up the idea of bigger signs and more outrageous hats to call more attention for the cause .
however , the de facto female leader of the protest decided that a more professional look would suit the cause better .
someone holds a sign promoting fair votes .
protesters camp out for their cause .
media members document the event .
a protester looks on .
a woman stares with deep interest .
what do people do on their weekends ? go to lego competitions of course .
my son is getting way to many ideas .
[male] [male] 's `` it '' was quite the hit .
it 's amazing what you can do with legos .
we even saw location location location complete with tiny hunchback .
this is my birthday gift .
a trip to the lego store to see all the designs .
there is my favorite band , megadeth !
also cool comic book characters .
i 'm definitely going to buy some pieces to be creative myself .
legos are cool !
this guy is an artist .
bozo !
this thing actually moved !
good lord..how much time went into this ?
the lego convention was up and running .
so many people created amazing things .
even things from movies got turned into lego ,
some made cool monsters .
they even made large buildings , all out of legos .
the lego convention started with some incredible creations .
one of the younger creators displayed his work .
a creepy it clown would be seen from far away .
a large squidlike creature showed just how imaginative people could be .
an incredibly complex house was a treat for architecture fans .
[female] and [female] were out on the beach with papa [male] and friends .
[male] smiled as his friends got together a kite for flying .
[male] covered his mouth while finishing a snack .
after a bit of work , [male] and [male] were able to get the kite up in the air .
[female] was unimpressed , although [female] was happy .
i fixed my roof today .
after that we all went out for a walk .
we stopped by the park .
on the way back we went through some alleys .
it was very cloudy today .
today i took my daughter out for a walk on the beach .
my husband and my brother in law came along as well .
my brother in law was getting his kite together .
when he was done , he let the kite fly high in the sky .
we watched him fly the kite .
[female] took [female] and i out to the beach
it was a bit foggy out .
[male] had a business call , and never caught any fish he promised us .
a lot of kites were being flown .
[female] loved making sandcastles , but got tired after .
today we went on our annual beach trip
we got up really early to get their before most of the crowds .
we had no trouble finding a spot to set our stuff .
we stopped by a local shop and bought a kite to fly .
the whole trip was even more special because it was our daughters first one .
it was a great night to go to the carnival
people rode all of the great rides
and then the night fell and it lit up like a firework
the farris wheel was shining bright in the dark of night
it was a great time at the park that night
the evening started innocently enough . my family and i went to the carnivale .
the night came on quick , and we decided a ride on the organization organization was necessary .
i started getting dizzy while looking at the center of the wheel . i needed to get a little distance .
i took a little red car to get away from the organization organization . it was overwhelming me .
we ended up leaving the carnivale , and heading home a little dizzier , and more content .
we went to the fair yesterday and had a great time on the swings .
could see everything from the ferris wheel .
and loved the colors .
hubby rode the sky lift but i wanted no part of it .
after we left i turned and snapped this picture . the fair in all of it 's glory .
going to the amusement park is a lot of fun the swing ride is always the first thing i go on .
this ride makes me dizzy , but i still can not resist going on it a few times .
this is what the park looks like after i get off of it at night !
i spotted the ferris wheel on the other side of the park , and i knew i had to ride it .
it was a breathtaking scene once i was at the very top of it !
went to the park , rode on this spiny thing .
`` it looks like a giant fly ethal . '' said my old man .
`` this ding-dang camera wo n't focus '' the old coot exclaimed .
i told him i would take care of it , he just had to change the setting .
we rode this late into the night , holding hands and remembering old times .
we came to enjoy a clipper 's game .
we saw our favorite team do a great job .
after we waited to sign autographs .
it was a fun experience talking about what we liked and did n't like .
pictures were taken all through the night .
there was a carnival in town last week .
we could n't wait to get inside !
we were so excited to ride the roller coasters .
we love how high up they go !
we had such a good time riding the roller coasters over and over !
at the organization game the fan cam is looking for eager fans to be shown on the jumbotron .
the two home town teams continue to battle for the rebounds .
outside of the stadium fans continue to walk around and have a good time .
strangers slowly become friends as they talk about the game .
as a man takes a group photo of his friends on this night .
an exciting basketball game starts off with a tip-off .
the women look up to see themselves on the jumbo-tron , embarrassed and amused .
in contrast , however , the large group of men are beyond themselves when they see their faces .
they begin to hoop and holler , content with the game at hand , and at their appearance within it .
the whole crowd appears to be getting into the game , with people sporadically getting up to get a better look .
the basketball payers stepped out onto the court .
the camera scanned the audience .
people cheered and got hyped .
the place was pretty packed .
the stadium was stuffed with people .
this japanese building holds a very unique garden in it .
the building stands tall as it is a few stories high .
behind it leads the way to an outside garden .
a path displays a very interesting walkway for people .
with all sorts of statues to look at while walking .
we took a trip to location , and started off by going sight seeing .
the stone plaque at the history museum , with a quote .
this beautiful building in down town location has been there for hundreds of years .
it looks like a wishing well , but it was really one of the garbage cans !
the city was full of these neat statures . here is one of them outside the gates .
i 'm taking a class on asian architecture .
it 's an ancient tradition .
asian architecture is unmistakable .
their gardens are interesting as well .
i find their statues especially interesting .
it was the kind of trip art lovers dream about . going oversees to explore the creations of artists world wide .
visiting the organization organization organization monuments was a breath taking experience .
next up was a traditional japanese temple .
even the incense burners were beautifully crafted
the final stop of the day was the jade carvings .
our trip to location was amazing .
we got to see how they built their temples .
they used such distinctive architecture and paid so much attention to details .
even the steps leading up to the temples were cool .
they were lined with statues that all had important meanings behind them .
roller coasters are scary .
this is a great spot to lose your lunch .
is this track supposed to be sideways ?
this roller coaster is also known as , `` scary plunge to your death , '' maybe .
if i were meant to fly upside down , i would have grown upside down flying things .
we went to see the new roller coaster in town today .
it has so many different loops .
and all sorts of crazy turns !
we love riding roller coasters so much !
we had such a great time and ca n't wait to come back !
the new roller coaster looked amazing with all the curved tracks .
the long curves up and the drop looked like it would be alot of fun .
then when it got lower and you can see where you would accelerate had me in chills .
the other new one looked like it would be a lot of fun too because of how high it went up .
then the loops in the track . i can see myself puking already .
another day at the carnival .
these rides were intense !
so many times , i felt like throwing up .
thankfully i was not the only one who was a little queezy .
going upside down , almost made the man in front of me have a stoke .
a group of friends chose a red roller coaster to try out .
it 's curves were sharp and scary !
the ride dove over and under itself multiple times .
afterwards the group decided to try out a blue coaster with a big climb .
it did a loop that none of them were prepared for !
today is the day that i decide to face my fear of heights .
i am at the amusement park and i ride on some of the down to earth rides before i prepare myself for ...
the great gasp . what is the great gasp ? pure insanity if you ask me .
i 'm not sure if i really should do it , but my friends are pushing me too .
well it 's too late now , i 'm going . wish me luck .
there was an old abandoned amusement park off the road .
there was a tall iconic structure that could be seen miles away .
as they looked around they saw the entrance to the water slide .
after exploring , they decided the leave the park .
admiring from afar and wondering what happened to their childhood park .
we tried to get into the new section of the amusement park but it turns out that it is still under construction .
it was a nice clear day for the park .
some of the rides were very scary .
they extended very high into the sky .
some of the road was marked off because of the construction .
we were n't aloud to go past the barricade .
the rides are intense here at the park .
the new ride will be revealed soon .
we tried to get good pictures of the new ride .
this photo gives us a sneak peak of things to come .
my friends and i went to an amusement park , but some of the rides were closed .
the ride i was most excited for was closed for the day .
i was surprised to see graffiti at the amusement park .
my friend took a ride on a parachute .
the parachute was huge and red , white and blue .
we toured this historical church on our vacation .
the church was filled with ornate stained glass art .
this window even included a prayer written within .
some of the windows were cut in elaborate designs .
leaving the church , we saw an old cemetery in the back yards .
we went to visit the church .
inside are lots of stained glass windows .
we enjoyed taking pictures of the many scenes .
they were all very beautiful to look at .
we 'll have to come back and visit again soon , it was a beautiful church !
we entered the old church the other day .
the first thing we noticed was the amazing artwork that the church contained .
we then noticed the amazing stained glass within the church .
whoever built this church was quite an artist .
after looking at all the artwork , we left the church , and made plans to visit again .
i went to church last sunday for the first time .
there was so much beautiful artwork inside .
the windows were all so pretty .
they had so much detail .
when church was over i felt very happy . i ca n't wait to go back this week .
there was once an old church with a unique set of stain glass windows that were in need of cleaning .
they were quite beautiful pieces of art and history , with vibrant colors that had grown dark due to dust .
a professional team was hired to clear the windows , and once they were done the windows shined bright .
the oldest stain glass window was the most beautiful of all with its unique blue hue .
after the windows were restored the church appeared to be like new .
[female] went to an air show last week .
they had four palnes doing maneuvers in the air .
they left white wakes behind them .
the wakes looked pretty in the sky .
in the evening they flew away to home .
today we saw some planes doing some neat stunts .
they did aerial acrobatics and made pictures in the sky
some of the pilots had amazing skills .
after the show was over we took a ride on the ferris wheel .
then we headed home to get some food and sleep .
the planes started the airshow simple with just jet streams and little stunts .
quickly the show added more planes flying closely together and doing stunts as a squadron .
the pilots did quick bank turns and left wild jet streams and amazing flying skills rule the air .
one plane did rolls and stunts that made his jet stream very twisted and jagged looking .
after they were done to end the show , they planes did a low height squadron fly by . it was a great show .
watching the air show at the fair !
i do n't see how they can do that !
i really hope they do n't crash !
that wheel looks like so much fun !
everyone leaving after the air show .
the day we went to see the airshow , a fair was also in progress .
the planes seemed to fly so close to the ferris wheel then fly off again .
then the planes did some amazing dives .
you could tell who was there for the fair , they all had shady umbrellas .
those of us there for the planes stood uncovered in the streets looking up at the sky .
he is getting dressed as his favorite character so see his favorite movie .
the line is n't too long and he thinks he 'll get in quickly .
that is until he turns the corner and see that the line is longer then he thought .
after the movie he decides to ride the ferris wheel and relax .
his final fun thing for the day is the carousel , because he is just a kid at heart .
the new cinema had a successful opening day .
people were excited to see the new exhibits .
the children could enjoy the merry-go-round .
the adults enjoyed the ride just as much as the children .
they had characters for all to interact with .
there was once a man who was a big fan of a famous children 's television show .
one day he read in the newspaper that there was going to be a be festival for his favorite show at the local theater .
he joined the line hours in advance with a group of other super-fans to ensure he would have a ticket .
as the festival began , he noticed that there were also rides and games for everyone to enjoy .
of all the rides his favorite was the old fashioned merry go round .
a new movie was being released about a popular children 's character .
the family decided to go to a new release of a movie .
they waited in a long line .
there was a giant ferris wheel there .
there were rides there such as a ferris wheel and merry go round .

he also decided to take a ride on the merry go round , which was a perfecting ending to his day !
someone had cleverly adapted an abandoned space into a bright graffiti covered area .
skateboarders and cyclists were making the most of the concrete ramps and vast space to test out their best moves .
the location eye looked over the chaos beneath , moving slowly and calmly .
a dhali sculpture stood out against the pale blue sky next to the location eye .
the view from the eye was amazing as the sun set over the houses of parliament and big [male] .
the sun was setting behind the old church .
a man was walking under the bridge as it got darker .
the graffiti on the pylons made the bridge seem less dark than it was .
the man decided to climb up on one of the pylons .
he watched his friend do tricks on his bike .
we tried to go all around town finding as many different aspects as we could . that is when we came upon this bmx park that was built within a freeway overpass .
the bmx riders were absolutely amazing , and did all kinds of different tricks for us , to show off a bit of their skill .
after the bmx park we came upon a fair going on on the outskirts of the town , and we saw a huge organization organization .
while walking up for a ride on the organization organization we could n't believe our eyes , as if an elephant is n't tall enough , this one had stilts !
from the top of the ferris wheel we had the most amazing view of the city . it was so gorgeous we never wanted to leave the view behind , so we took this photo so we could save it forever .
there are many forms of art , including intricate graffiti .
the body in motion could be considered artistic , such as this athlete with his bicycle .
the pattern of the colored cars on this ferris wheel is intended to be artistic .
an elephant on stilts is used to clean the higher cars of the ferris wheel .
the cityscape , a collection of architecture , is a collective art piece .
a far away view of the bike and skateboard park .
the biker is practicing a trick at the park .

we won a bunch of prizes from playing games !
we love to go see the fireworks on the 4th of july .
they always put on such an amazing display .
it is so much fun watching them light up the night sky .
there were so many different pretty colors this year .
we had such a good time this year !
these fireworks are amazing ! look how cool they look .
these are so close we could reach out and touch them . they are spectacular .
oh , look at the purple one ! my wife 's favorite .
these must have cost alot of money but they are worth it .
the finale was the best we 've seen all week .
i was really looking forward to the fireworks .
this picture shows why i was so excited . they are so beautiful .
everybody around me was enjoying them so much .
i could feel my smiling from ear to ear from the excitement .
this finale drew such a round of applause from all those around .
we found a great spot to stop and watch the fireworks .
amazing colors lit the sky .
the sound of the fireworks popped in the air .
cheers from the crowd could be heard even from where we were .
the grand finale was an amazing sight ! happy 4th of july , location !
this was the best night for fireworks .
these are towards the beginning , you can see the large pink one
these are some low level fireworks with some high level ones .
this was a nice display of about 10 fireworks that went off at the same time .
this is part of the grand finale .
when i woke up this morning my bedroom was full of flowers ! growing from the floor ! this one was practically in my face !
over by my nightstand was where this one was standing brightly . it 's so beautiful but how did it get there ?
i jumped out of bed and ran to my closet to see a bunch of these pink and yellow flowers . they hissed at me ! ! scared i jumped back and ran to my door .
this huge red cluster of prickly red needles was blocking my doorway ! i could n't escape ! ! i was crying and peed all over my floor .
i turned around to see a giant red flower larger than my head rise up and emit a huge puff of smoke into my face and i fell onto the floor and died .
art helps to depict a story . painting is one way to do it .
it does n't matter what story you want to tell . you can find inspiration anywhere .
even from flowers . flowers have such vibrant colors .
and such interesting designs . it makes you so creative .
what do you think ? it looks pretty good to me .
a man has found a way to display beauty of an object as mundane as a spray can by using artistic license .
even grafitti can be made to be beautiful with color and design .
however , nature is a stiff competitor as the life size view of a flower is quite beautiful .
this intricately designed pattern gives a different look .
and finally , the work in progress as a man continues the quest for beauty .
the botanical society opened its doors friday .
i am an avid flower lover .
the bright pinks are so vibrant .
they have unique varieties as well .
we love the red ones the best .
at an art show , there were some artwork that portrayed a style of graffiti . here 's one of a paint can used to spray the graffiti .
here is one that you would think you were in an inner city underpass .
then in the midst of all the graffiti art there was this one . very interesting change of scenery and style .
did n't know what to make of this one . seemed to be some underwater sea urchin or plant of some sort .
then it was back to graffiti art depicting a man spraying the graffiti on a wall .
the statue sits in the garden .
animals sometimes roam in the fields .
we tend to plants , flowers a d other shrubbery .
it complements the land well .
nature gets really close sometimes .
the start of the sightseeing tour , taking photos of each other from opposite sides of the street .
very clean windows along the covered walkway reflected the street below .
the strange little cottage was a stark difference to the modern architecture around it .
even more strange to see someone tending to a perfect flower garden in the middle of all the concrete and glass .
the local butterfly population seemed to be grateful though !
we went to my grandfathers nursery in location .
some of the things i saw there seemed futuristic .
in the middle of it was a very traditional home . it reminded me of a gingerbread house .
the landscape was full of contrast and sharp colors .
i saw a butterfly there that i have never seen before in my life .
my friend and i went to location yesterday for a photo shoot .
i never knew holland had such amazing architecture .
there was a cute little traditional hut near the large building .
a woman was gardening outside of the hut .
i walked up to her to see the flowers , they were unusual unlike anything i 've ever seen .
we found this interesting scarecrow during our tour of the gardens .
the horse does n't seem to mind the ornaments hanging over it 's face .
the garden are kept up beautifully as was explained to us .
these ground take the car of several dedicated gardeners on the property .
the succulent flowers certainly attract various species of butterflies .
this photographer lives in the city , but he also has a secret life as a squirrel mascot .
being a squirrel mascot is n't bad , but sometimes he like to take a break .
he will leave his mascot head behind because it is really hot .
and he will get on his bike and take a ride through the countryside .
his favorite place to rest is under a nearby radio tower . it 's far enough away to make him feel like he is king of the world .
this is the man in the bear mascot .
he was left alone in the garage .
we found him like this and ran to find help .
but when we returned he was gone .
we will remember him always .
drunk squirrel is drunk .
he ca n't find his car in the parking garage .
as he wanders the parking garage , he is attacked by thugs .
they remove his wallet and head .
a candle is lit in vigil , a reminder of drunk squirrel 's plight .
[male] is like what the heck it that , is that a drunk squirrel ?
[male] follows knowing this has to be a good story for his blog .
as [male] rounds the corner he notices that the squirrel has lost his head , and he picks it up and notices the rest of the squirrel is going out the door to the parking lot .
[male] jumps on his bike and follows .
as he gets close to the tower , he losses him . no one will believe this , i need to stop drinking early in the morning .
i went with a friend to learn about photography .
we took some silly pictures using huge mask .
we even tried just taking pictures of the mask without a person in it .
i learned that many ordinary things could be photographed to great affect .
there were photos to be taken everywhere , even right above our heads .
we arrived at the park ready for fun .
a map allowed us to plan our fun .
this was ridden several times .
the directions are written in more than one .
lodging areas were nice and cozy .
the worst thing about going to the amusement park is that i have the most terrible sense of direction .
i want to ride the ferris wheel and i can see it in the distance , but i am having trouble finding it .
okay here is another map . i need to go to the left and then a slight right .
i 'm lost , but luckily i found more directions .
at last , i get to ride the ferris wheel . this is my favorite ride of all time .
i was so lost the other day . i knew the the fair was but i did n't know how to get there from here .
i could see it over there but the path was blocked .
the map was so hard to read .
this sign makes much more sense .
thankfully i arrived before they closed .
taking the family to the amusement park i could n't believe how big it was .
we had to walk a lot to get to all the great attractions .
i kept getting lost , thankfully there was always a map close at hand .
handy markes took us to all the important places .
we ended the day with a ride on this giant ferris wheel .
my boyfriend took me to kariya last year
it consists of a shopping mall next to amazing oasis
it 's ferris wheel was just amazing
the directions were all in korean language but still we managed
the dining area was just amazing and gorgeous
this is [male] . i met him on social media and he lured me into a date with him .
he was so sweet and nice . he took me to see a large [male] mouse ferris wheel and we really hit it off .
2 hours after our date began we were lip locking while this was going on . i could n't stop kissing him . we wanted each other so badly .
come to find out earlier that evening he was doing the same thing with this woman ! her name is [female] .
before [female] it was a girl almost identical to me named [female] . the three of us girls are now hunting him down . so if you see this man contact one of us !
out of town to give another presentation .
on the stage i the same speech as always .
adoring fans want their pictures with me .
i get my picture taken again and again .
but i get to end my night with the one i love !
the man is giving a lecture .
the happy couple poses in front of mickey .
the light show is spectacular .
the couple smiles for the camera .
the girl in yellow poses with the grey sweatered guy .
[male] takes the stage at comic con , singing , `` do you want to build a snowman ? ''
[male] picks up a girl , promising a ride on his organization organization organization wheel .
he gives the girl psychedelic drugs .
when she passes out , he finds another girl .
when she wakes up , he denies that there was any other girl on his ferris wheel .
i was really nervous during the show but i managed to finish and everyone applauded for me .
afterward my family and i went to the fair to hang out .
there was a wonderful water and light show there .
after that we decided to grab a late dinner .
it was a very good day .
the fair came to town and we took the whole family out for a night of games and rides .
a carnie enticed us to play a game .
we played a few rounds of the ring toss , where you try to hook the ring around the top of a bottle .
after playing a few games , we could no longer ignore the smell of the fair 's delicacies !
after devouring a delicious cinnamon-sugar topped funnel cake we enjoyed the view from above on the organization organization .
food is one of the best things about carnivals .
people flock from all over .
they put money into the games .
the game leaders make playing an event you want to do .
the lights go down and it 's back at the food again .
we had an interesting day at the amusement park .
a man with a funny hat made a threatening hand gesture at us .
then we played the ring toss . perfect game !
that night we were a bit hungry so we stopped for some fries .
finally , we took a relaxing ride on the ferris wheel before going home .
we all went to the carnival .
we played carnival games .
we tossed rings onto soda .
we had lots of junk food .
we finished the night on the organization organization .
one day a man decided to take his kids to the local carnival .
they were excited and invited to try man games by the carnival 's employees .
of all the games the ring toss game was their favorite .
after a long day of playing games they were famished and decided to get some fries to eat .
right before they left for the evening , they took ride on the organization wheel .
going to a theme park is a lot of fun there is loopy roller coasters everywhere .
there is even scary attractions that tourist love to take pictures of .
just imagine walking and seeing a huge spider standing tall in front of you .
the pond is a great place to throw some bread out for any ducks or swans floating by .
but the big roller coaster is the challenge of the day as it is the highest ride in the whole theme park .
watching two swans swimming in the lake .
walking underneath a huge spider .
getting in the spider ride .
third ride , the jet star 2 .
second ride , the lagoon .
two pleasant swans greeted us as we passed by the little pond on our way to the fairgrounds . my girlfriend had told me she wanted me to conquer my fears .
unfortunately , the two swans would be the only pleasant thing , as a giant metal spider came into view .
fortunately for humanity , it was n't real , and it was only ride unoriginally titled 'the spider ' . my severe arachnaphobia nearly lead me to soiling myself when i saw it .
sure , heights i can take , as i proved to her when i got aboard the star ride .
hell , even fast drops i can take , as i again proved to heron the next ride . ... but not spiders . never spiders .
this place looks like so much fun !
until i saw this would be one of the attractions !
this was not cool , so i decided to leave .
this is much more up my alley .
then i ended the day by getting on this for my excitement .
an amusement park offered many ride options .
there was also a spider exhibit .
these were n't real spiders , but statues and art pieces .
a nearby group of swans enjoyed the pond adjacent .
the large wooden roller coaster was the most visited attraction .
i watched the craziest light show tonight .
the lines of light were everywhere . it looked like an artist had painted them .
these reminded me of ufos .
i imagined being under the sea with this display .
this was my favorite . it looked like a giant waterfall . it was a wonderful show .
i took my family to the local 4th of july fireworks show .
i brought both of our children , this was their first fireworks show .
they were a bit scared of the noise at first .
after a little while they got used to them and really started enjoying the show .
by the end of the night ask they could talk about was all the pretty colors .
the lights at the carnival are always quite awesome .
they are elegant and artistic when captured just right on camera .
these look like angels racing each other .
these lights almost look like angel wings .
of course the ferris wheel lights are always great whether on camera as art , or in person !
the teacher handed all the children glow lights , blocked all the windows , and shut off all the lights in the classroom .
the kids saw the complete darkness as an invitation to run wildly with their glowing lights . they swirled them high over their heads .
in the dark , the teacher had a hard time keeping track of which student was which .
she twirled her glow stick high and asked for the other students to copy her motions .
it took some time , but when the students copied the teacher 's glow stick movement they created quite the show .
celebrating the 4th of july with some late night fireworks .
i love all the pretty colors in the sky .
it looks like they are running in one direction .
it seems nothing but a blur , but it 's still beautiful .
the finale was the best part . what a show .
this has been the most amazing structure i have seen.there are so many colors and designs.it looks like we are staring at the earth .
when i focus on this , the first thing i can see is what looks like a moon .
then what appears to be land or mountains peak out from behind it .
on the other side looks more like the land i speak of because it is green .
at first i thought it was an ocean.i bet if you had a moment to sit and relax you could get lost in thought just looking at it .
this room is cool .
it 's so cool
that i felt
that i needed
to take so many pictures .
from the first glance , the building was grand .
there was a red and yellow pillar .
there was also a supporting blue pillar .
many visitors came to inspect the building .
the building was really spectacular overall .
the family never had been to this place before and was thrilled to go after what their friends had told them .
they were shocked at the stellar array of colors that filled the room .
pointing up to the ceiling , it looked as if the pictures were dancing along the walls of the room .
the family had just entered the area and wandered around the same room for hours as if hypnotized by the colors .
the room was so captivating that the family lost track of time and forgot to catch their afternoon trains back home .
went to a new museum this weekend !
the color scheme was amazing .
i really enjoyed sharing this experience with my mom .
the staff showed us a demonstration of how the color worked .
a great mothers day weekened !
there was a car show
packed with many old cars
people came from all around to see the cars
it was a great time so many people loved the cars
all of the cars had so much history and were a sight to see
the car show was right down the street so we decided to visit .
there were so many classic cars there .
we went up and down the street appreciating their beauty .
you can see how many people were appreciating the show .
we finally finished with with a picture of this beauty .

all along 3rd avenue , people gathered to admire the machines .
the grills of some cars were works of art all on their own .

people were looking at them
on third avenue .
they were all old .
i went to the park to hula hoop .
i was very good .
i also rode my bike for a while .
when i got to the beach it was almost dark .
there were some people playing instruments nearby .
beaches in location are quite the place .
you have bikers everywhere .
beautiful views , as well .
there are even rollercoasters to ride !
musicians litter the streets .
we had a little family hula hoop competition to start the day off .
my son was the winner .
we then walked along the boardwalk , seeing the various artwork .
we arrived at the fairgrounds later in the day and rode on the rollercoaster .
we heard a man playing the sax on our way home .
[male] was hola-hooping for years and came out to the park to practice to beat his hola-hooping rival .
[male] , [male] 's rival , saw [male] approaching and challenged him to a hola-hopping competition , but they both wanted an impartial judge .
[male] and [male] rode bikes along the beach side and asked everyone to judge their hola-hooping competition .
rejection after rejection , they spent all day looking and were about to call it a draw since they could n't find a judge .
suddenly , a street saxophonists saw the two with their hola-hoops and agreed to judge their competition only if they listened to one of his songs .
hula hooping !
i was not to good at it .
a nice mural .
sunset .
we had a great time !
it was an asian party
many different foods from all asian countries
the people loved the food

the line was huge but we enjoyed every minute of it .
the banner welcoming everyone was really large , it was impressive !
the best food was really hard to come by .
we got to the festival and set up shop .

all the chinese food looked delicious .
i had a hard time deciding what i wanted to eat .
grandpa knew exactly what to get .
they did a great job on the decorations this year .
we had a great turnout for the event .
we awoke christmas morning and a snow had laced the ground .
the pond was beautiful , with the glistening trees reflecting off the water .
we decided to walk the dog and go for a journey .
we ended up at the gingerbread house and finished the walk
at the christmas tree overlooking the pond .
it 's a snowy day today .
however , the sky cleared and there was beautiful frost over the bridges .
even the water well was coated in snow .
we had a picture taken of us with our dog .
even the christamas tree that was put up was lovely .
we fear the cold weather arriving but when it does , it 's always beautiful .
the snowy trees around the water are spectacular .
we grabbed the dog and went for a walk in the fresh snow .
our house does n't even look chilly ; it looks warm and cozy .
i 'm so glad we got a decent snowfall for the christmas season !
christmas with the relatives .
it seems like we are in a movie .
the birds did not use this fountain .
[male] the dog was trying to chase a poodle .
a great afternoon with [female] .
the town was covered in snow .
the churches ' chapel had been blanketed in snow .
the family and dog walked through the snow covered town .
the town was also adorned in christmas decor .
they made their way to the christmas tree in the center of the town .
we went to a carnival with an ice bar .
it was really fun , we went on a lot of rides .
we especially liked this one and stayed on it for hours .
i had some issues with my camera but was able to capture it all .
here is a group picture of us before leaving .
the girls and i were so bored at night .
we sat around the fire but were getting bored .
we took a walk and found the carousel was on .
i loved how the horses were painted .
the girls and i ended up having such a great night .
my friends and i decided to spend girls night out at the carnival !
an open pit fire is always a cozy place to start .
the carousel brings back such great childhood memories .
although as kids we loved this ride , the carousel horses are pretty scary looking .
you can see how much fun we are having . we found some friends !
ladies night out ! we stopped at this gas station first .
and hung out on the cold boardwalk , warming our hands at this fire .
lets ride the mary-go-round . said [female]
i like this horse . [female] wanted something tamer .
the five of us around [female] 's sleigh .
it sure was cold that night of the holiday fair . the ice sculpture wo n't melt in these temps .
i love the old time feeling of a merry go round .
especially the lights !
but do n't spin too quick , someone might get sick .
family togetherness at holiday time , nothing better .
early morning risers are ready for the day . gorgeous view of the ocean .
first the kids wanted to ride the rides then we headed to the pier .
kids wanted me to feed the ducks..they did n't want to get that close .
took a walk on the pier until it was time for dinner .
navy pier was very cool . time for dinner .
i saw flowers .
a sunrise over the lake .
a ferris wheel .
some fibers .
and navy pier .
we headed down to the pier to see the sunrise . nature is beautiful .
the rides at the pier are n't open yet but we can enjoy it anyway .
the ducks are out early to get some food from the tourists .
the view behind us at the city is spectacular .
the pier in the morning light is a sight everyone should see .
it is images like this sunset that make lasting memories of family vacations .
though my wife and i will remember the sunrises and sunsets , the kids probably will remember the giant organization organization .
all of us will remember the one friendly goose who would eat right out of our hands at the pond in the park .
boardwalks are not always made out of boards . it was neat to see the boats docked with the skyscrapers in the background .
all of our vacations have a water theme . we really like boating , and we spent a lot of time at the organization organization .
a beautiful day was spent near location location .
the city offered all manner of attractions .
they took time to feed some geese off the water nearby .
they strolled up and down the marina looking at gathered boats .
most of their day was spent admiring organization organization and the amusements it offered .
it was the 4th of july .
the fireworks display was beautiful .
everyone was having fun watching the fireworks .
the town loved watching the fireworks .
they were sad that they had to wait a whole year for another display .
we love to see the fireworks every year .
they always have such pretty colors .
i love how they light up the night sky .
the many different color explosions are so amazing .
we always have such a great time and we look forward to it every year .
this one was way up in the air .
what a shower of color !
looks like a celery stalk blew its top off !
the end .
oh ! this one must not have gone off when it should .
we ended our weekend watching the fireworks .
i loved the view and all the beautiful lights .
this was one of my least favorite .
the finale was awesome ! look at the beautiful artwork .
what a wonderful ending to an awesome outing .
this year we shot fireworks for the 4th of july .
we went all out and got the biggest we could .
the sky was lit up with the big fireworks we were setting off .
all the neighbors came to see the show we put on .
i was told that they could be seen from miles away .
finished some last minute holiday shopping at organization .
the late hour meant the nearby carousel was mostly empty .
though there were plenty of shoppers rushing to get home .
the coppers were out patrolling .
while others were waiting in line for a cup of hot chocolate .
was in downtown location for a little business here and there . work was done for the day , and we were out at night .
we found this very bright merry go round , and decided to take it for a spin . we did get a little dizzy .
at some point i may have had an out of body experience , because i felt i was floating over the merry go round . or ... no wait i took this from a building across the way .
we ended up walking past a local band that was kicking it loud and proud . we boogied for a few minutes .
later firemen and firewomen came to bust it up , as it was getting a little too rowdy . fun night indeed !
we went out to attend the opening of organization . they put on quite a show .
carousel rides and everything ! what fun !
a lot of people showed up for this event .
the weather was a bit wet and chilly but that did n't stop the crowds from coming .
good food and fun lights are always on hand at a great festivity .
nearby festivities offered all sorts of fun .
a nearby carousel gave a welcome diversion from other activities .
groups of people meandered the glowing streets .
a group of police nearby ensured things did n't get out of hand .
the celebration began to wind down as the night dragged on .
this building was so breathtaking !
the merry go round was a fun one to ride !
after that there was a quick walk on the street !
they all had fun walking with each other !
it was a wonderful time outdoors !
i stood in line for three hours , just to get a great seat
instantly i saw a woman being silly on the tennis court .
it was worth the wait , when the silly woman sat down next to me , named colette .
the location was against a foreign opponent to win a gold medal .
seeing organization win the gold , meet colette , and fireworks makes for an amazing night .
i was really excited when i got to the game .
everyone was waiting for me to play .
i did my best .
afterward we brought out the flag .
we had a fireworks show to end the event .
[female] was excited to start her tennis match in the grand finals .
she was so excited that she went to the tennis court well before the match was scheduled to start .
[female] chose to use this as an opportunity to practice her swing to warm up .
after practicing for a long time , she took a nap but overslept . her tennis match was going to start soon .
as the fireworks burst overhead , [female] awoke and rushed to the tennis court for her match .
a large crowd gathered for a planned fireworks display .
time was spent on a nearby tennis court as they waited .
the couple took time to get a selfie before the celebration .
a large flag was marched out to the delight of the crowd .
the stadium fireworks started with a bang !
me and my girlfriend attended a championship tennis game today .
she took many pictures on the court .
she even pretended she was one of the players .
it was finally time for the game to start .
there were even fireworks !
the kids were here to conquer their fears .
this year , the organization wheel would not cause them fright .
strapped in tightly , they look up at the hateful sun above through the deadly gears .
shuddering in fear , [female] nearly wets her pants .
the people below look so small .
there was a festival in town today with a parade .
there were clowns and all kinds of booths set up .
we had a great time going to all the different booths .
so many people were there having a great time .
it was such a fun day and we had so much fun together !
[female] and [male] went with their family to the fair .
the first thing they did upon entering was find the ferris wheel .
as they got on they looked up and marveled over how tall it was .
at the top of the ferris wheel [female] peered over the edge of her seat .
far down below she could see people milling about the fairgrounds ; they looked like ants !
there was a carnival in town today .
there were many people and rides .
the ferris wheel was the most popular ride .

the whole street was full of people .
the fire truck came through during the parade !

when in location , my husband and i decided to go to this fun park .
we started our day with a ride on the wheel .
next up was the awesome roller coaster , big deeps .
we saw these fun little things to stand behind .
it was a great time wandering through the faux village .
welcome to the location wild west . where getting to be a cowboy or girl is fun .
the town has a variety of activates to do to entertain you through the day .
there is even a huge ferris wheel to ride on .
during the summer you can even sit in the lazy river and ride out into the night .
during the night the waters are calm and beautiful to look at .
we arrived at the location location theme park for a fun day .

afterwards , we took some funny pictures .
we ended the day by doing some souvenir shopping .
another vacation time coming , ca n't wait til we get the amusement park after this pit stop .
we got a great view from the ferris wheel .
the roller coaster went real fast , i was scared .
my husband and i acting goofy and playing around .

we arrived at the park early saturday .
the ferris wheel was huge !
riding the roller coaster was really fun .
mom and dad took a silly picture together .
visiting all the shops was a good time .
i arrived on the scene with my misfit mask and was ready for fun .
we went and jumped on the location ride .
and , then we had to wait in line for the tickets ...
and , they sure seemed expensive .
however , the organization organization play was worth the money .

i did n't try this one , too scary .
one of my favorites !
my son wore a mask and scared people on the boardwalk .
the bright lights on the boardwalk drew us to some rides .
i get dizzy on rides that go in circles .
it 's gotten expensive to go on amusement rides .
my favorite movie had a fun ride on the boardwalk .
[female] loved her dog chica .
chica was 1 year old .
he was the happiest dog .
he loved his home town on aggieland/
[female] was happy she had an awesome dog and a boyfriend .
my girlfriend loves animals .

this is a picture of a dog .
this is a picture of a couple .
this is a picture of a restaurant .
this is a picture of a building .
i never quite understood why she loved that dog so much .
he was the prime thing in her life though .
she made sure to take plenty of time to take pictures of him .
he was actually the first thing she got when we moved here .
i 'd like to hope that i keep her just as happy as that dog does .
this person loves her dog .
she ca n't resist kissing it whenever she has a chance .
the dog knows it has an owner that loves it .
her rural home gave her plenty of room to let the dog run around .
her boyfriend loved her and supported her interest in animals .
the nighttime lights are always beautiful .
watching the ferris wheel light up the sky is so unique ,
the memorial stays lit up every night .
watching the city at night causes excitement inside .
you want to continue to stay up and out amongst it all .
my journey into the city of the dead was so interesting .
it was dark and i was wondering around and found this covered area . it was full of wreaths and notes to dead loved ones .
here is the monument with the wreathes lining the bottom . it was so tall .
i walked around and the clouds lightened up a little bit . i found this cool building across the water . it was neat .
i also saw this really neat ferris wheel in the distance . i 'd love to live here . seeing this every night would overjoy me .
the views from the railings in location were absolutely gorgeous , here is one showing the projected ad 's on the side of a building .
we were so looking forward to taking a ride on this amazing ferris wheel that was totally covered in led 's .
we absolutely had to go to the monument for the glorious dead . the location was completely heart wrenching .
just looking at the city in black and white you can almost imagine you have gone back in time , the architecture has all survived so amazingly well over the years .
but before long you are back into the present time period by one view at just how modern the city can be just one street over from a tower from the 1800 's .
last night was a good night to walk down town .
with all of the bright lights it was hard not to go there .
we stopped at the monument to pay our respects to others .
we walked down to see the clock tower and all the other buildings downtown .
the city is a very busy place , but there is so much to see and do there .

my wife was so happy and excited to be there .
that night , we went the fair to ride the wheel .
the woman is the star of this year 's oktoberfest parade .
she started the morning as anyone would , with a cigarette and a giant mug of java .
the starting point for the parade was next to the kiosk selling christmas wreaths .
the parade began and continued through the streets .
the parade ended near the rides , by the giant ferris wheel .
it was a great october fest this year , i even got to walk through the parade .
i got to go right up to the tuba player and take a picture of him .
these horses were huge , they were pulling a couple guys that were really throwing back the beers .
i brought my favorite beer mug for the occasion .
last of all , the ferris wheel was amazing .
last week we went to a german festival .
they had bands playing and marching in the streets .
they had the clydesdale horses that they show on beer commercials .
of course , we had to drink their german beer .
before we left , we got to ride on the organization organization which was lots of fun .
in location all parades have a few things in common . pretty girls in funky costumes ,
polka bands with tuba players , and
wagons pulled by draft horses .
after seeing all of that , my wife wanted a beer and a cigarette .
i , however , wanted to ride on the organization organization .
it was a beautiful day to be alive
[male] really loved the ocean
he loved all the attractions also
he pondered life 's meaning
and met a new friend at the beach
grandpa and grandma watched the baseball game .
the weather was perfect for a game .
afterward , they enjoyed some quiet time on the dock .
meanwhile , their grandson enjoyed his doritos and fed the seagulls .
they ended the day at their favorite burger restaurant .
we saw great sights as we took a walk along the piers .
grandpa loved just sitting and enjoying the water .
the view back across the water at the city was awesome .
this guys on the pier was set up to stay a while .
many people hang out on the pier . it has a calming affect and is beautiful .
my son and i decided to go on a trip to the pier this afternoon . first , we stopped for lunch at [male] 's deli .
the water was choppy today , but the weather was beautiful .
from the pier we can see the beach and the hotels lining the coast .
we always see interesting characters on the pier and today was no exception . everyone loves the pier .
we sat and relaxed for awhile before heading towards the fishing area . we had a great afternoon !
on my way to the beach i caught this romantic scene .
i had the end of this dock all to myself for a minutes .
this gentleman chatted me up on the dock .
i complimented him on his glasses . he got them for his birthday .
this hamburger place is where i always lunch at the beach .
we arrived at the fair and it was beautifully lit up .
we rushed to wait in line and ride some rides .
we could n't believe the crowd that had arrived .
we finally found what appeared to be the best ride in the park ...
and , we told [male] to take a picture of us at the very top !
the fair was bright and colorful .
first i rode the ghost ship .
then i got some food .
i rode the upside down ride next .
i rode one more ride before going home .
tonight , we went to the fair .
we always make our way towards the rides first .
after enjoying the rides , we walk around playing some games . i try to win the biggest stuff animal i can .
right before we leave , i always pick out my favorite ride , and ride it one last time .
i had a wonderful time at the fair , and i ca n't wait for it to come next year .
night rides at the fair are amazing .
this is just a glimpse of what all we will be riding .
the gang walking to the shortest line for rides .
i was terrified being on this ride , i do n't like going upside down .
here is another view of it , but from farther back .

a friend new of my obsession with bridges .
she had suggested that i check out this bridge , but wait until night .
she was absolutely right , the bright purplish-pink color was beautiful .
it completely shocked me when it turned blue .
when i drove under it i was amazed .
i could see the bridge coming up and even from here , it looked huge .
as we got closer , it just seemed to get bigger and bigger .
finally , we were there and it towered over everything .
the writing on the supports looked really ornate .
we stayed until night and that 's when the bridge lit up , making it even more beautiful .
the large bridge nearby had a secret .
it appeared normally in the day and in the evening .
nobody would have suspected anything .
but as the sun set and the darkness set in ,
the glorious lighting burst forth for all to see !
this was our first trip on our new car .
we decided to go straight into the big city , right after the bridge .
the views of the city 's bridge were amazing when it was lit .
purple , blue , and other colors changing enhanced the views .
as we got closer , it all looked like a fantasy movie .
today is the big game .

the street vendors try to sell anything they can think of .
the mall was much like the mall at home , just slightly different .

i went on an amazing trip to location and saw some of the most wonderful buildings .
outside this building were tons of birds that created a great scenery .
there are several roadside shops that people love to frequent , day and night .

at any time of the day or night , you can see the strangest things on the street , like this fake horse dressed up in clothes and headphones !
we stayed at a very fancy hotel when we went on vacation .
the building was so beautiful .
everything was so shiny and expensive looking .
there were many pretty things everywhere you would look .
we had such a great time and really enjoyed the hotel !
[female] is visiting her parents and staying in a 5 star resort hotel .

the halls are enormous it feels like she 's in a castle .
she makes her way up to her room .
carrying her bags she ca n't wait to see what her room looks like .
this store looked way too expensive .
she decided to give it a visit anyway .
after visiting many rooms , she still had n't found anything to buy .

one day a man bought himself and his wife bicycles so that they could get in shape and explore the city .
the wife was happy to participate and quickly began to ride her bike .
her husbands followed behind on his bicycle as he rode through the town .

they are thinking of what we should do next .
this is what they decided on !
we had to say hello to mr. disney and [male] to make it a complete day !
this school vacation we spent at location
the kids were thrilled with the rides there .
this is at the end of a long day waiting in long lines .
we splurged a little on souvenirs of course .
i thanked walt disney 's statue for a wonderful destination .
this was by far the best family vacation i had .
we went to organization . the theme parks were awesome .
between rides we would stop for a snack .
we even got the chance to dress up like pirates !
before we left , we had to take a few more pictures of location location .
i 'd been bumming lately , so decided to go visit fantasy land for the day .
walking in the door , i felt a little familiar sensation , watching a boy with a long nose walk by .
then an owl seemed to be asking me who i was , and where i was heading .
i prayed that my fantasy might be seen some day . to be the most famous writer in the kingdom .
i wandered a spell , then found the mad hatter club , where i danced until it was too very late . good times .
mom and dad took us here for our summer vacation .
i looked up and seen the coolest castle ever !
pinocchio was the first to welcome us inside .
mommy and i rode in the carriage just like a real [female] .
i could n't believe how cute these little rascals looked .
our trip to visit organization was great . no one tops them for color and fantasy .
pinocchio is always on hand to greet guests .
the architecture here reminds one of actual real buildings even though most are facades .
leave it to organization to request wishes of it 's guests . what fun !
the hatter always brings a smile . he is so silly that we just had to check out his ride .
a trip through fantasyland was lots of fun .
characters like pinnochio could be seen wandering the street .
[male] [male] 's castle was available for inspection .
a sign indicated that wishes could be used in this happy place .
another indicated the mad hatter may be nearby .
my family took a trip to organization organization and our first stop was fantasyland .
we saw pinocchio walking around there !
we saw other awesome disney characters around too like this owl .
we saw organization phrases written around the park like this one !
our last stop on our trip was to see the mad hatter !
they got ready for the show .
the band got the crowd warmed up .
the singers could really sing !
the crowd got into the show .
the dancers ended the performance .
we visited the local fair today , there were many booths .
food was also plenty , there was so much to eat and do .
there were even pony rides for the kids .
i really liked this antique car that had the motorcycle in front .
the kids especially enjoyed the game they were playing .
it 's always great to see what bands will be playing at the fair .
this guys is really getting into his part by dressing up .
these latina singers could really belt out a song .
they put on quite a show for us , complete with tricorn hat .
the latinas can always be counted on for a colorful dance !
my friend was part of the weirdest boy band ever . they had a girl in the group .
he dressed in what looked like a musketeer outfit .
she sang along with her brother , who was in a fedora .
my friend sometimes got to sing too but not often .
they even had backup dancers .
my friend has a band .
he plays the keyboards .
they have a female vocalist .
sometimes my friend sings too .
they also have backup vocals .
we 're going on a road trip driving through the desert .
when we happen to come across a small county fair .
we were just in time to watch the rodeo .
the kids had a great time cheering on all the organization .
my favorite part was seeing all of the different farm animals .
i had a great time out in the wilderness .
there were many flowers there .
i also saw a llama .
i had a great time at the rodeo as well .
the llamas were very curious .
the land had small shrubs and was very western looking .
there were some alpacas at the rodeo .
the horse riding was a great show .
the winner was a man .
they even had an alpaca riding competition .
it was another beautiful day for the riding tournament .
the llamas looked on as they saw their friend , the horse , show off his skills .
the rider could barely hang on as the horse dashed at high speeds along the field .
the horse did a sudden stop and began to buck the rider off , but he held on , barely .
more llamas came and were impressed to see the horse 's fantastic maneuvers and were inspired to train hard like the horse .
deep in the northeast , a number of events took place .
alpacas were displayed by local farmers and caretakers .
soon after , an equine demonstration showed riding techniques .
the riders showed proficiency with their animals .
the alpacas had a great view for the horse events .
they planned to take in as much of the city as possible .
the stop along the river provided food and shopping .
the cafes never seem to run out of unique food ideas .
they found more shopping options later .
the evening provided a bit of rest .
we left the hotel in the morning in search of a good breakfast .
we spotted a likely spot to eat .
the restaurant menu was in english so it was easy to read .
we got our hearty breakfast .
then we headed off to see the hot spots of the city .
we had a fun day visiting the big city .
we were feeling hungry , so we stopped off at a pleasant looking restaurant .
the menu had many appealing food and drink items .
we settled on an omelet and some bread , which was very yummy .
after a long day , we walked home on the sidewalk .
i went to the big city today .
i decided to have lunch .
the restaurant seemed very fancy .
i then went to the conference i was in town for .
later that night i ran into many beggers .
my friends and i went downtown last night .
we found a restaurant near the water to eat at .
the restaurant was called mon ami gabi .
the drink specials were hung up on the wall .
as we were leaving we gave a man begging some money .
i went to shark 's fin today . it was so much fun !
i wandered down a little location type street and saw so many cool things .
this panda drawing on the side of a building . it says tufu .
later on i saw this really large poh seng jewellers sign . it was so bright it hurt my eyes .
i turned and saw a large dragon in my face ! it startled me and a chinese man laughed so hard he cried . it was a fun day .
at the first stop of our tour we took the boat on the left for a cruise on the canal .
we saw a happy bride taking a picture near the docks .
later on we ate a late lunch at organization 's location restaurant .
at night it became crowded with revelers celebrating the new year .
the lights at night were amazing to watch .
on my first visit to location with my fiance ' , i saw a restaurant selling shark 's fin soup . as a vegetarian , clearly i passed on that dish .
but , with so many good restaurants and vendors , i had no trouble finding a delicious vegetarian dish .
afterwards , we roamed the area taking in the ambiance and people-watching . it was a beautiful day .
the night was the best though , when he took me in to the poh seng jewellers . and , we picked out an engagement ring !
he proposed to me under this handsome dragon . are n't dragons good luck in some cultures ?
well i now know what happened to the shark on `` jaws '' and i had to come to location to find out .
here we are on vacation in location and enjoying it with hundreds of other people .
here is art work that we found on a building in location .
went into this store to buy a beautiful ring in memory of this vacation .
he is one of the floats at the japanesse parade .
location had its annual festival starting at the restaurant shark 's fin .
hundreds gathered around the town in celebration .
the artist tufu presented his most recent work of art .
poh seng jewelers showed off their new sign , even though they spelled jewlers wrong .
and finally the dragon was brought out and they city danced the night away .
the winter trip was exciting .
we had time to take photos with the locals .
we brought lots of money to spend .
some creatures sparred in the snow .
we had our fun in the snow as well .
we went to the town where location location is for a weekend , it 's a really unique place .
it was surprisingly cold next to the falls but it was too beautiful to pass up a photo !
i got a shot of a rainbow within the falls , this is a great day !
afterwards we went to try on hats . [male] looks so silly !
the kids really enjoyed their time here , especially with all this snow .
after eating at a nearby location location , we set off to visit location location .
the waterfall was an incredible sight to behold .
we even saw a beautiful rainbow in the mist .
i got a funny hat to commemorate our visit .
then we capped off a memorable day by making some snow angels .
winter is a special time for our family , we always take at least one trip .
dad was excited to have his picture taken in front of the falls .
i was quick to grab my camera and get a snapshot of the rainbow in the mist .
i got dad this goofy hat since it put a smile on everyones face .
it would n't be winter without a few snow angels .
our winter trip to location started with location location .
i could not resist getting a picture taken with bullwinkle in a mountie uniform
our change may look like 50 cents but is not quite in american dollars .
we met these two velociraptors playing outside .
the kids could not resist making snow angels and tumbling down the hill .
the trip was quaint and exciting .
many cozy diners and cafes were along the way .
here is one example of a popular food spot .
this stop offered a place to shop .
directions were easy to follow and no one got lost .
we were going for a drive .
finally we reached the south of the border .
we decided to stop at a leather shop .
next we thought of going to hot tamale .
but we decided to go get hot dogs instead .
during our road trip we decided to cross over into location , here is where we passed the flags marking the actual boarders .
one of the first shopping centers we saw had this absolutely giant gentlemen wearing a sombrero letting us know we were officially `` south of the boarder ''
we found [male] 's leather shop , which actually had a ton of different items , from belts to boots , and they were all made with great craftsmanship and talent .
we were trying to decide what we wanted to have for lunch when we saw this huge sign for hot tamales .
but we were instantly distracted by the extremely long wiener dog version of [male] the big red dog , and ended up having to eat there !
while we were on vacation in location location we stopped to see some unusual sites .
there is a place there that has a giant man standing out front .
we ate at this place that truly had very hot things .
the beach shop was a very interesting place to see as well .
after that we got back on the highway to see more things .
there was once a family who moved to a new city .
while driving through the town they saw many strange looking restaurant signs .
there were even signs for specialty shops .
the most popular restaurant appeared to be the organization organization organization organization restaurant .
despite seeing many signs for the popular restaurant , the kids stated that all they wanted to eat were hotdogs .
i went on a plane trip the other day to see a different city .
the food there was really terrible as you can see .
we had to go through this to get to a better place to eat .
we found this place right outside the airport , and it had pretty good food .
we saw tons of art from famous artists before we headed back home .
driving the the airport for my big business trip .
here i am aboard the flight waiting for takeoff . not too many people around me .
san francisco i have arrived ! my business partners are waiting .
such a nice day in a beautiful city that i wish i could explore but ... .
here i am in my room getting my next presentation ready .
i got to be the first one on the plane this time , my trip to location location is off to a good start .
i made sure to bring a bagel and cream cheese on the flight , i did n't want to eat too much airline food .
when i got to the airport , i decided to take the [male] into the city , it 's supposed to be the main commuter train in the bay .
i made sure to go to one of the many cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s that are sprinkled all over the city .
i got to see some really awesome modern art amongst all the buildings while i was there .
i won a trip to location location , but the flight was a red eye
and only served crappy sandwiches .
when i got to the airport , half the gates were closed off ,
and the restaurants were just preparing to open .
despite being hungry , i really enjoyed the beautiful sculpture in the terminal and the architecture of the terminal itself .
about to take a flight to a secret destination .
eating breakfast on the plane .
landed at 8 in the morning .
about to order coffee before staring the day .
huge indoor round abstract sculpture .
[female] got to go to sea world with her family .
she got to see some colorful fish .
there was also some scary looking sharks there .
the killer whales put on a show for the crowd .
[female] 's favorite was the dolphins because they looked like they were smiling all of the time .
we had a trip to the aquarium today .
we got to see so many different kinds of sea animals .
they even had scary sharks !
the many different fish were so pretty .
we ended the day with seeing the whale show . we had a great time !
our trip to sea world , looking in the aquarium at all the fish .
the dolphins were hungry and wanted attention .
the shark was one of the scariest , i 'm glad there was glass inbetween us .
look at the beautiful fish , so many different types .
during the show , we saw a beautiful site .
a family took a stroll through an aquarium and museum .
all manner of fish could be viewed .
in addition , sharks were nearby to put fear into the hearts of all .
a large killer whale greeted the crowd .
the dolphins seemed to enjoy playing with their audience .
we went to the aquarium and gathered around the vast center tank .
dolphins delighted everyone with tricks and funny sounds .
the shark was impressively fierce .
there was a variety of tropical fish swimming together .
the whale leaped into the air and made a huge splash .
my friend found this funny looking fruit on the ground .
he took it around the city and took profound pictures .
we went to this building and took more pictures .
he used the fruit to get a ride on the highway .
we were dropped off by this telephone post .
today [male] found a coconut .
he decided to keep it with him forever .
the coconuts name was sally . he was to be married
he took the coconut to see the town and everyone gave him weird looks .
they are still happily married 25 years later .
it was time to take mr. coconut on his adventure !
little coco was so stoked to see his first parking lot , i mad sure he enjoyed it this his best friend , me ! ! !
mr. coco and i hung out all day , frolicking through the many fields near my home town .
this is the first car mr. coco got to ride in , and it was my car .
i 'm so lucky to have mr. coco , i plan on showing him the world , and this overpass !
mr. coconut has traveled far . the views he has seen have been amazing .
even grocery store parking lots do not escape mr. coconut 's travels .
time for some relaxation and coconut meditation .
back to reality with traffic and noise.cars zipping by.and large buildings all around .
this was the scariest part of mr. coconuts adventures . the cars below were fast and the overpass was high .
`` this is a coconut that i found & it was all alone . it wanted to go home . ''
`` i promised the coconut i would help it search across the land to find it 's home . ''
`` is his where your home is ? '' the coconut told me no .
`` how about here ? is this your home ? '' no again .
finally the coconut let me know we 'd found it 's home . seeing my confusion the coconut revealed that it 's a new generation of genetically modified coconuts .
the fair was bright and loud .
people were screaming and having fun .
[male] was tired and bored . he was working too hard .
he decided to blow off some steam at the shooting range .
then the fireworks made the whole day worth it .
the fair was a fun place to hang out .
everyone went on rides .
this man is trying to win a prize .
the rides are very popular at the fair .
everyone was glad their town had a fair .
the family arrived at the carnival with the kids .
the kids immediately ran to the gravity ride and spun around and around .
while the kids road , dad wanted to surprise them and played the claw game to win a toy for his children .
the kids came off the ride tipsy and the family walked around for more interesting attractions .
they arrived at a crazy and twisty house where the kids could enter and get lost in the labyrinth of rooms within .
tonight , i went on a date to the fair .
i had a good time riding some rides , but i can only take so much .
my date decided he would show off by winning me something .
i think he enjoyed playing the games more than winning the trinkets .
afterward , we finished up by watching the firework show they put on . it was the perfect end to our date .
the giant wheel welcomes you to the theme park .
there are many attractions if you like some adrenaline .
you can also try to win some prizes .
shooting things and hitting the target is my favorite game .
when it is already dark , adults and children enjoy the fireworks show .
the caravel was a hot topic in the town .
everyone was having fun .
people were excited to to be in the town .
everyone loved the celebrations .
even people who did n't go to the carnaval were celebrating .
there was a boat show in the harbor today .
many people were there to see all the boats .
they had many different types of boats to show .
it was cool seeing all the different boats .
we had a great time and ca n't wait till they come back next year !
the fair has come to town .
everyone is gathering in for the fun .
and a reinactment of the organization organization organization .
the ships are coming in .
and people show their patriotism
the boats crowd the harbor .
the people are in joy as they observe the different models .
some smaller sailboat gives contrast to the larger .
a massive boat that looks like a warship approaches .
a very old looking boat that looks like a galleon makes it 's way past the people .
we went down to the beach and came to a large ferris wheel .
then we walked closer to the beach .
we joined the crowd to watch the ships in the water .
some of the ships flew various flags .
people also watched the ships from the windows of the buildings .
the kids at organization organization organization were surprised when a big white bus pulled up .
they saw it was for the army field band .
the kids were excited while the stage was being set up .
before they began their performance , the army musicians had the kids salute the flag .
the troupe performed and the kids loved it . what a pleasant surprise for the day .
one of the most wonderful things to hear is the army 's band play music .
even more so during special even such as 4th of july .
star spangled banner always brings a tear to your eye when watching fireworks.well at least it does for me .
makes you proud when people of all differences come together and forget the issues long enough to see this beautiful display .
there are so many colors to enjoy , but i think i like when the blues and other colors mix together like here..looks like red white and blue .
the bus picked us up early in the morning .
it was an army field band bus .
we got to the venue and started to setup .
we said the pledge o allegiance .
we then put on a show for all the parents and military members .
on the 4th a number of attractions were available .
one of which involved the organization organization organization .
they took the stage and prepared to perform .
the crowd saluted as the anthem was sung .
they made their way through many different songs with great precision .
it was fourth of july weekend and the bus was filled with people heading to an annual celebration .
everyone on the bus were members of the organization organization . they were in the band .
when they arrived , the stage was still being set up .
when the show started , they began by singing god bless location . some children in the audience saluted them .
the show was great and very patriotic . everyone had a fantastic day as they waited for the fireworks to begin at night .
i went for a walk around the town last week .
most of the buildings are very old and run down .
some of them are abandoned .
some of them were barely standing .
there was also graffiti everywhere .
the subway was shiny and new .
but the city was starting to fall apart .
there was grafitti everywhere .
even the trains were abandoned .
only the ferris wheel was still in good condition .
[male] rana way from home when he was 16 .
he wandered the streets doing graffiti everywhere .
he slept in construction sites during the night .
soon he made a home at the railroad tracks .
eventually he died here on the street . dont run away from home .
this is the old part of town .
there is graffiti on some of the walls .
construction workers are trying to fix up this part of town .
the buildings next to the railroad tracks are dilapidated .
this warehouse is the next building to be repaired .
the building was old
and had graffiti .
there was construction
near the tracks
and the old buildings .
we arrived at the coast and were excited about the views .
we headed immediately for the lighthouse , which was up a winding road .
from the lighthouse , there was a wonderful view of the rocks being hit by the waves .
we parked and walked down on to the beach and walked the cold sand .
it was a beautiful sight .
we went for a big walk on the beach on our vacation .
there was a lighthouse at the end of the path .
just do n't look down because it 's scary !
the beach was deserted , we could do whatever we wanted .
afterwards we rode the ferris wheel and enjoyed our night .
it was saturday afternoon and i took a walk by the beach .
about a mile into my walk , i encountered a lighthouse in the distance .
it was starting to get rather misty but it only made the cliffsides of the beach even more beautiful .
the sky was getting darker but the waves continued to crash into shore .
i walked for hours until very late afternoon and the tides were low , then i knew it was time to go home .
it was such a pretty day when we went out .
we saw many different things and i was glad to have brought my camera .
the fog was moving in off of the water .
it made everything look so eerie .
when we moved in mainland a bit we found this abandoned fair .
we got up the hill in time to see the low clouds .
we continued back down toward the beach from there .
the view from up top once we could see the beach was awesome .
we got down there and walked around .
then , we headed back into the city .
we went to a family reunion on location .
here 's hank , trying to figure out how the camera works .
the park we went to had a few monuments from the civil war , including this cool canon .
here 's hank and [male] , trying to decide how to get that beehive down !
on the last day , we went to the river for a picnic and a swim .
today was the day .
the trip to the farm .
there was old machinery .
a neat windmill .
and a tractor .
we saw two coyotes .
[male] was looking for gold or something .
real cannons used in the civil war .
a really remarkable tree .
a canoe ride before lunch .
we set out to go get some feel for the land .
we met up and started exploring the area .
there was lots of old machinery and cool stuff .
we got some shade underneath a tree before making our way to the river .
we got down there and continued our adventure .
a trip was taken to the great outdoors .
from a campsite a man admired the view with a looking glass .
nearby settlements shows classical cannons and other machines from times gone by .
two men stopped to talk about their day and what they 'd seen .
they took some time to head to a nearby stream and admire its beauty .
a wonderful little lamb set on top a pryramid looking for something to get into .
remain seated is the sign that was displayed on the wall for them all to read .
he jumped up on to the horse and got ready for a ride .
after , it came in motion and he held on tight .
after theride he had so much fun he need to take a time out and set on the bench .
i love bugs so much .
this spider is cool .
so is this one .
then i went to the museum .
and the pyramid was cool .
we saw a lot of awesome nature sights on our morning walk .
what is this bug we see ? we watched him for a while .
i did n't like the spiders we encountered , but i do agree they were pretty cool .
man made structures are almost as awesome as nature 's , but not quite .
what is this building we have come across ? our little stuffed lamb might know .
along the huge wall , we were able to see a small toy .
there was also a warning sign for awareness .
i put the toy on the carousel and then i rode with it .
i took pictures with my new carousel buddy .
this was probably one of the best days i have ever had .
while walking in the woods we saw a lot of cob webs .
look at the nasty spider on the leaf .
there is another type of spider coming down on a web .
we were waiting to get on the subway .
what an awesome creation of a pyramid , very unique .
it 's fair time in location .
there are several rows of games where people can win prizes or tickets .
the tickets can be redeemed for food and drinks .
or they can be used to go on the various rides in the carnival zone .
it would n't be a fair without the locals throughout the area playing music every year .
the midway of the fair was lined with exotic fun booths .
some of the booths required you to pop a balloon to win a prize .
the food at the fair was delicious at the cheese steak location .
the man was seen waiting for customers to play the game .
the organization wheel was set up to give riders a thrill .
our night at the fair was great . we loved the games !
some of the carnival games are hard though . this is popping balloons .
does anyone make a cheesesteak as good as any carnival ?
we rode the organization organization and got a good view of the surrounding area .
there are always musicians there willing to entertain .
there are so many things to do at the fair .
they have plenty of games for the kids and people who like it easy .
the fair food is great and they have something for everyone .
there are also plenty of games that are harder or require more skill .
and of course there are lots of rides for everyone to enjoy .
the carnival was in town !
there were games everywhere !
and food as well .
bright lights shone all around .
and in the background you could faintly here the jazz music that kept the people moving in beat .
it was a great day to have some fun
the rainbow colors flew high
there was a red fire truck for people to see
the people enjoyed the sunset
it was the perfect way to end the day
there 's only one way to go here , straight up .
riding the rainbow road from this direction seems colorful and wonderful .
the underside , however , reveals the more mundane mechanics necessary to keep things flowing .
[male] will never forget the first time he took his kart out onto location location .
it 's like a wonderful story he will want to tell his grandchildren time and time again , as his own life fades away the memories of the rainbow road live on .
first we had to climb to the top in order to get the view .
it was crazy , seeing the rainbow shaped arch from this side .
the truck was really cool , the way it turned into a storefront .
but the best view came as the sun was setting .
the lights from the distant fair were beautiful .
a young man went exploring one fine summer morning .
after many hours , he happened upon a man made rainbow with a restaurant attached on one end .
with much excitement , he went and ate inside this restaurant at the end of the rainbow .
with a full belly , the young man walked along the pier .
as the sun set , he watched the beautiful lights of the city .
a large outdoor art display was visited .
a large rainbow shot forth into the sky .
a nearby truck exhibit was intricately painted and adorned .
a beautiful sunset really set the mood .
at night , the colors of the nearby buildings painted a beautiful tapestry .
toured an old fort . there was a giant wheel on the outside .
another fort down the road . they must have been really afraid of being attacked .
the city is so old and has alot of history .
someone in this city has alot of money . this car is expensive .
awesome view from our room . where should we eat ?
the old wheelhouse was the setting of a gruesome murder .
beneath the arches to the east of the wheel , three men were hanged .
and off the edge of this tower leaped the murderer , a woman .
in these shadowy corridors the police ran to try to save the men , but it was too late .
once again , st. [male] 's organization took the lives of the innocent -- and the guilty .
the water wheel in this old structure was quite a sight .
we took a lot of pictures of the old architecture .
new blends with old in these buildings .
a modern day car seems out of place in this area .
what a wonderful photo opportunity we have found up high across the landscape .
the romans built watermills that lasted for ages .
their forts can still be seen outside town .
inside , their designs still are used as parts of modern buildings .
we took a trip around to see all the different ruins .
from those ruins , we were able to see a great view of the city .
we went on vacation to explore some history .
the country has some of the most beautiful ancient ruins . it is always fun to walk around and let the history soak into you .
after walking around in the old part of town all day , we stop by the local square to get the flavor of the local culture and find a room for the night .
i had a great time yesterday , but it is time to move on to our next stop .
i can wait to see what is next , but i 'm already building fond memories of our visit .
today was the day .
we saw lots of cool stuff .
neat old helmets .
lots of signs .
and a sweet trailer !
i was out for a few groceries , and noticed the saturday market was up and running .
i wandered through a few booths , looking at air socks , dresses , crafts .
some collectibles from war were being watched by a very alert watch dog in a window .
later , we wandered into people showing their antique cars and wagons . here an old motorcycle and bus .
i ended up sneaking onto this bus , and was in location location before i woke up . the adventure was quite a story .
as we entered the fair grounds , we saw a very quint looking trailer for one of the travelers .
someone had made paper monster figures that blew in the wind .
we also got to see vests and helmets from the past !
but i 'm pretty sure the signs were meant to make us confused .
before we left , we got to see a very cute little rv and it made me jealous it was n't where i got to spend the night .
carnival time ! we stopped by this colorful display to see what it was like .
colorful kites sold by colorful characters . the owner also made homemade jewelry .
this lively old timer not only sold army supplies , he did a skit called all american wars in 5 minutes .
all the attractions on a sign , when they move camp do they have to change the sign ?
the workers lived here to . touches of homelife were scattered through the carnival .
our community celebrated the beginning of summer with an outdoor caravan fair .
lots of interesting buses and caravans set up fancy displays for the visitors .
this doggie was watching over a display of fancy motorcycle gear .
this colorful signpost shows all the incredible things we could do .
some of the caravans had unique and impressive designs , which made the whole event a visual feast .
when the sun rose , we got up .
we started to light our first balloon before the sun was in the sky .
later that day , we did the maintenance work for one of our balloons .
our maintenance man is very good at fixing our rides .
once he was done , we went back in the air .
the balloons were lined up to be inflated .
the first balloon was inflated !
all of the the balloons were inflated and ready to go !
all of the balloons were floating away .
by the end of the night , the balloons were clear from the skies .
we went to a balloon festival yesterday .
they had to blow up the balloons with a big blower .
when the balloons were inflated , they lifted off the ground .
soon they were soaring into the sky .
when the day was over , the balloons came down , and we went home for the night happy to have seen the balloons fly .
we had to get up early to start inflating the balloons .
it 's a lot more work than what people think .
a few hours later , we finally had them all ready to take off .
up we went !
we stayed up in the sky until the sunset . what a beautiful experience !
the morning of the big day . i had saved up all year , and put so much planning into today .
here is my balloon lit up at dawn . the light of the fire drowned out the light of the sun for a bit .
here is another balloon being filled up , or rather heated up .
here is dannys balloon . we thought it was a good idea to do this together .
when i was in the air it was such a thrill . i am going to do this every year .
our trip to location was full of history .
we were able to tour all of the areas we had only read in books or seen on television .
the history and it 's people are full and rich .
big [male] is like the location tower to location or the statue of [female] to location .
the cathedrals command such reverence like i had never seen .
while touring the country we got to see a large building with artifacts inside .
the inside had many cool structures of old dinosaurs .
while walking down the street we saw a marching band walking perfectly synced up .
the ferris wheel was in such a cool spot right on the water .
to end the day we checked out a large government building with people walking in front of it .
we went to the location location
inside these centuries old buildings life goes on .
the streetswere clean and neat .
i had to see the giant wheel !
the palaces are immense .
the tourists loved looking at the historic buildings .
the interiors were usually just as detailed as the exteriors .
by walking a few blocks , here would be more to see !
people could even pass the old carnival grounds where the ferris wheel was preserved .
the final stop along the trail was usually the old court house .
cathedrals were once built as an intimidating reminder of the church 's great power .
the interior of the cathedral is a giant maze .
those who denied the church 's might were entombed here .
or they were imprisoned here .
even today , people gather to worship at the cathedrals .
there was once a man and his wife who decided one day to visit the an old village where she grew up .
they walked all around the old market , and found an old woman making all sorts of artwork .
her most favorite thing to make was small umbrellas .
the couple asked her is she would make a piece of artwork for them to take home .
so she made a piece of art on his clothing to take with him as they continued to explore the village .
we spent the day at the market .
there were lots of arts and crafts to see .
one vendor sold handmade umbrellas .
this is the woman putting together one of the umbrellas .
we took the bus home in the afternoon .
on vacation we visited a nice outdoor market and tasted free soup .
there we watched a person make a fancy umbrella .
the umbrellas came in many shades of color .
the person also hand-crafted a design on dad 's pants .
the stitch was a happy elephant .
today we explored the market .
we saw a man making parasols .
his finished ones were colorful
dad saw a clothing painter .
she painted an elephant on his shorts .
while we were in location we stopped to see some local vendors .
they make many neat things .
these things were really colorful and looked nice when they spun around .
we watched this lady working on a piece .
after we were finished we took a bus up the road to a new place .
the show started out with the lead singer singing acapella .
then he added his electric guitar .
next , his bandmate joined on the keyboard .
together the two sounded great .
the show really gained momentum as the songs continued .
we went out to see a friends band play to tonight .
the first band used different types of percussion and keyboards .
my friend 's band was next and played a 30 min set .
the next tow bands were okay although not my type of music was very enjoyable
the night concluded with the last two band playing a song together .
me and my friends were playing at a nightclub one weekend . this is me singing .
my friend , cliff , plays guitar . he is one of the best out there !
my other friend , [male] , is a pianist . he used to play with another local band .
together we rocked out to a sold out crowd that night !
we had a blast ! everything was excellent and i hope another weekend can match that one !
the singer practices his vocals during rehearsal .
the guitarist practiced some chords .
the keyboard player worked on scales .
once they were ready , they started the concert .
they really rocked out all night long .
[male] is the lead singer of his band .
his friend [male] signs backups and plays the guitar .
[male] is the keyboardist of the band .
they 're recording a new ep today .
[male] is the most excited because he gets a guitar solo on the next song .
this is me . i 'm touring jakoosie today and i 'm looking for cool stuff .
i wondered upon tibidabo . these blocks are so neat . they spin around .
i walked a little further and found a large ferris wheel . i took a few spins and threw up on the boardwalk .
since my stomach was empty i figured i 'd stop and get some dinner . this looked sketchy and i 'm not sure what it was because the woman i bought it from did n't speak english but i ended up eating it all and it was delicious !
my last stop was this huge church on a hillside . it was magnificent ! i passed out on the steps and woke up naked .
being a tourist is great we are going to be sure to get lots of pictures .
this is the prettiest cathedral in the city .
and this is a picture of our tour group .
we have to get pictures by the fountain . be sure to make a wish .
finally after a long day of touring we are going back to our hotel .
the tourists are taking pictures of the moment .
the famous statue is visible even at dusk .
there is a long line to get into the attraction .
there are many tourist taking pictures of the statue , and their surroundings .
there are signs , however , they are in spanish .
visiting the city i took pictures of everything , inlcuding other photographers .
the view of the church from afar was glorious .
we were n't the only tourists visiting that day .
grabbed a snapshot of this photographer and his impressive camera .
you could find art in the most unexpected of places .
today will be a great day for excursion .
look at those unique blocks !
might as well jump into ferris wheel to see the bigger view .
i got so hungry and got this delicious food .
i 'm on the move again , time to go there and pray .
i really like quilts .
i think this is a naked lady .
i better take two pictures to be safe .
my clothes are awesome .
is this a squid ?
we spent the day at an art showing .
there were different types of artwork like this painting .
some people displayed handmade sculptures .
a couple artists even displayed larger pieces like this mural .
there were even people practicing live impromptu !
there were all kinds of different embroidery artwork at the show , here is a ferris wheel
there was even some more risky embrodery pieces that were hung on the walls .
here is a little closer towards the beautiful piece that was catching everyones eye at the show .
who wants to have to reach inside their pocket to get their lighter when you can have one hanging on the outside !
this piece was absolutely mind blowing , it was a complete mix of different art mediums and there was water color , oils and embroidery all on one canvas , truly remarkable .
the entrance to the new museum was to say the least that stellar .
the paintings looked like they were drawn by a drunk hobo .
the carvings looked juvenile .
the mural looked like graffiti in my neighborhood , but the ones in my neighborhood look better .
i cant take it ! ! i want my money back ! ! ! give it to me . thank you .
at the art gallery , there were many interesting art like this round stitch .
there was also a stitch of a woman dancing fierce .
a closer look , the woman seemed to be singing too .
dad decided to show off his fancy stitch work .
we also looked at some weird paintings .
opera time ! i am getting ready to go inside to see a great operatic performance .
i arrived during the show . i hurried to my seat and took this photo of a wonderful song called pickles in the atmosphere .
after the performance [male] the man behind me took my camera and snapped my picture . he was so rude but i pretended i was happy to get him to leave me alone .
i exited the building to see the sun rising ! what ? where did the night go so fast ? ? was i drugged ?
all of the sudden two buses appeared out of thin air ! ! i fell down and [male] picked me up . i looked at him and then i ran home . i 'm never coming out of the house !
our group rode to the theatre by bus .
we parked a short distance away and had to walk a couple blocks .
the lobby of the theatre was massive !
here were our seats and our view ; the inside of the theatre was lovely !
these are some of the performers on the stage .
the concert we decided to go to was amazing !
we found a lot of other people there too .
after the concert we decided to buy some of their merchandise .
the way home was going to be long and treacherous .
we eventually got back though and we were very tired .
we are on the bus heading downtown to see the concert .
after getting off the bus , we have to walk 3 walks to get to the concert hall .
the lobby of the concert hall is very big and very well lighted .
10 minutes before the show we start walking to the auditorium to find our seats .
the lights were turned off as the concert started .
the family went on a trip to location .
during their time there , they enjoyed walking around exploring the streets .
they also decided to get tickets to see a show .
there were many others in attendance .
the show was a once in a lifetime experience .
today is the day [male] and i go to prison . on a tour that is !
it was so ominous and eerie feeling .
the walls were all worn and dirty . we ventured inside to look around .
[male] wanted to be locked up . only joking . we left out of there pretty quickly .
the outside was neat , huge guard towers lined the waters edge .
we went to go visit an historic prison .
the jail cells looked very scary looking in .
a boy decided that he would go in and take a peek inside of a cell but got scared and ran out .
this is a very good attempt at a prison selfie
near the end he got enough courage to go into a cell
dad always said if you misbehave , you will end up in the local jail .
here is your cell .
prisoners look so little in this space .
but at least you 'll get yard time .
and then you 'll be in lockup the rest of the night .
we spent a lot of time yesterday touring the prison .
it was a huge place . there were plenty of other tourists there as well .
inside of the prison was very dark and spooky .
some of the cells were the same size as our bathroom .
after the tour was over we were very tired from walking around the prison .
today we got to visit an old prison that is not in use any longer .
they still had the old fashioned doors .
we were able to walk through it during a tour .
everyone seemed to enjoy it although a little scary at times .
this is a picture if us standing inside the cell .
the village was a place for child play .
figurines and toys were sold throughout the shops .
some mimicked figures from around the globe .
other toys were of religious figures .
holiday figurines are always fun .
i am shopping today for my daughters birthday . she loves cookie monster and i think she will enjoy this stuffed toy .
i also decide that she could use a new pair of pink flip flops .
on the way to the check out i pass by the display of location toys . she ca n't get enough of [male] flinstone , so i put him in the cart too .
after shopping i head to organization .
i order an iced coffee for myself , and get 2 coffees to go , one for me later and one for my husband .
i was trying to find the best toy for my child so i spent a few hours in the toy store .
i looked at almost all of their toys .
some of them were kind of strange to me .
other one 's seemed like strange ideas for toys .
in the end i decided to buy this garden gnome .
while at the lake today we visited a few shops .
they sold some very colorful flip flops .
they also had some cartoon characters .
there was a small diner in there as well . they sold coffee and sandwiches .
we ordered some coffee to go so we could get back to the water .
there was once a store that specialized in children 's toys .
but over time their sales plummeted so decided to expand out to children 's shoes to try and boost sales .
all the while continuing to promote their popular toy brands .
despite their new venture sales were still low , so they decided to change the entire store into a popular coffee shop .
they sold a lot of popular coffee and iced tea drinks to their surprise .
we went to the block party this weekend .
they had a lot of food . i really liked these turkey legs .
check out this fry stand , it 's pretty cool .
it was really crowded and hard to find a spot to sit .
the concert was awesome and i 'm sure we will come again .
the day starts out with a banana and some water .
[male] likes to take a nap in grass before heading to the party .
quick stop at one of the food kiosks .
once at the party we try the fried chicken , my favorite .
we end the night with some red stripe .
i got up this morning and made a quick breakfast .
then i laid around in the sun for a while .
i was still hungry so i went to get some chicken .
they served chicken legs and hotdog wrappers .
fortunately , they served beer there .
you just never know what you are going to see when you spend a day at location location
to start with i went for the turkey wings instead of the hot dogs .
although i was tempted to get more snacks after seeing this big ad for hot fries .
instead we strolled the boardwalk .
and took in a concert .
we are preparing a delicious breakfast while getting ready to go to the picnic .
today is a day to put on some sunglasses , lay down and relax .
there are so many concession stands , it 's hard to pick just one .
fried turkey legs are so delicious and filling .
there 's nothing like washing a tasty meal down with an ice cold beer .
i went to the fair last weekend .
there were a lot of rides there .
i played many games .
the view of the ocean was beautiful .
i went for a walk on the pier .
the old carousel was still operational on the boardwalk .
the view from across the boardwalk of the city .
a older building that is showing its age on the boardwalk .
the ferris wheel was seen from a distance towering over the area .
the boardwalk was not busy on that nice day .
during our day on the pier , we rode the carousel !
the view out across the water is fantastic .
we saw and visited all they had to offer out near the pier .
the organization organization looms over the pier . we rode it at night though !
the view as you walk the pier is great . the morning light is soothing .
we rode all over , and when we stopped we found this fair not in use .
they still had all of the rides up , but no one was there .
all the stalls where lit up . it was a rather confusing sight .
we wandered off down the boardwalk .
the water was this neat purple color and the setting sun turned everything this wonderful shade .
a trip to the amusement park started with a carousel .
the view from the park showed a lovely body of water flanked by other buildings .
the fairgrounds had been there for quite some time .
the ferris wheel was a great place for a bird 's eye view .
the nearby pier and boardwalk were a relaxing break from the fun .
we were at the war memorial and they provided dinner .
we were able to view the old weapons..
including the military canon from the civil war .
and , they showed us how to blow glass..
and , the old water wheel .
i went to a historic site and saw an old antique wheel .
we were served yummy finger foods .
then they showed us an old bell .
there was even an old armor suit there .
then some children performed a play for us .
fried bananas , i 'm in heaven !
i wonder what these slots are for .
a real cannon , it 's not loaded though .
it got very hot !
old machinery is still very impressive .
today we visited a restaurant with a historic theme .
there was a variety of condiments all in separate bowls available .
we saw a giant silver bell from 1937 .
i even got my picture taken with a knight in armor !

hanging in the air is a giant bicycle wheel
a buffet of food is organized on the table
a giant comemmrative bell is on display .
the woman stands next to the spacesuit for a picture
the children dance together in a scen of the play
i came up with a genius idea to create economical sturdy huts .
i spent years working on different designs until i came up with the perfect one .
it was going to be economical to buy and very easy to put together .
with my designer was easy to create a tight-knit village .
this was imperative to the design because i wanted the huts to be used in villages .
i take boring pictures .
like this one .
i like spirals .
see , more spirals .
and some other shapes too .
in the middle of class , the teacher thought that a power point presentation would help the class understand a complicated topic .
however , the strange slides only made the students more confused .
the teacher attempted to make metaphors involving galaxies and plants to help the students understand the difficult lesson .
still , some of the students did n't understand so the teacher switched to slides that explained how the mathematics behind the spiral design impacted the lesson .
it took some time , but the students began to understand and the teacher could explain more abstract geometric concepts later in the lesson .
the kids sat in computer class looking at images .
when all of a sudden a strange language appeared .
[male] clicked it and a new page opened .
and another , what was happening ?
[male] 's teacher came by and noticed , and helped him exit spanish mode .
the guy was in a cube
and saw a tent
that was all different colors .
he designed blocks
and printed them out .
while we were in location we went to an amazing show .
lights flashing everywhere i liked it .
it also featured women in traditional costumes .
they were very beautiful .
the show ended quietly with the women on stage .
we went to a tradition chinese show .
there were great big traditional drums .
then there was a dance and fighting sequence .
the play continued and was very dramatic .
their outfits were great and pleasing to the eye .
the first thing i noticed was the amazing colors .
the ninjas with the swords had my attention after that .
the actress in the play was beautiful .
the red stood out so beautifully against everything .
the play was so good , i was really sad when it ended .
the show began with traditional drumming .
then ninjas came out on stage .
the princess next appeared .
then the heroine came on , carrying an umbrella .
the play then really began as other actors came on and we started to understand the story .
this exciting show begins with a drummer playing a very large drum .
a group of ninjas appear on stage .
they are after the beautiful princess .
this character saves the day .
at the end of the show the actors prepare for their final bow .
[male] had fun at the beach .
he went on the ferris wheel .
he watched some friends skateboard .
he even got a fortune from the fortune teller .
while reflecting at the garden he knew he had a good day .
there are so many things to see in this city .
there are many beautiful places here .
they even have a carnival down town .
there are some interesting things you ca n't see anywhere else .
this is such an amazing city and i love living here !
i met up with a friend on the boardwalk .
we ended exploring the amusement section , enjoying a few rides .
later we took our skateboards to the local park and skated a couple hours .
we passed by one of those old fortune machines and decided to find out our futures .
we finally ended up by the gardens , enjoying the beautiful colors .
i told my sister to take a picture next to the edge .
she wanted to go to the fair next so we went .
there was a man who was skating and he brought us to a skatepark .
i wanted to buy this crazy souvenir .
the coil garden was by far one of those coolest creations i have seen .
i grew up coming to the beach every year . i loved it so much i eventually moved out here .
now i have kids of my own . they love going on the rides at the boardwalk .
when they grow up i want to teach them to love skating as much as i do .
this was my favorite machine to visit as a kid .

we finally had a free day to do what we wanted .
when we saw these balloons , i could n't say no and ended up with two .

best day ever with my very best friends .
we rode around town on bikes .

and truly amazed by the dolphin performance act .
i had never been to an entertainment venue like this before , so i saw a lot unique things for the first time .
this was really neat to watch the theater show that was put .
the dancers really gave their all too , and the crowd was as pleased as i was with their performance .
my favorite part though was the panda bears !
at the end of the day , we all just relaxed on the deck and talked about what we were going to do the next day .
fairs are very cool places .
you can do all kinds of things there . you can see acrobatic acts ,
you can go on rides ,

the building where i work is pretty neat .
its built in a curved shape .
here 's the view from the side .
it has lots of glass .
the marble floors are impressive too .
the downtown city was full of shadows and stalkers and lights . the shadows seemed to worship the fountain , and we could n't handle it .
we backed away from the fountain and could see it was ringed in more of the unearthly light .
the walkways and pavers were lit up as well ; it felt like being in a tron movie .
we wondered if the light was the source of the shadows .
we gave up and got close to the light like everyone else , and entered the water . we were no more .
it was a beautiful day to walk along the pier .
[female] and [male] wanted to take their daughter on a walk .

some of them were tourists as well .
the buildings were very colorful at night .

the city looked somewhat plain in the day time .
the features of the buildings do n't stand out as well during the day .
the buildings come alive when they are lighted .

people flock to the city center at night .

we where walking around town and decided to follow the crowd .
we made our way to the center of town and looked around .
the buildings where really cool .
we hung out till night to see what goes on there .
the streets lit up and stayed very lively .
the town during the day was a busy , rushed place .
a person caught a break in a roadside chair for a moment before resuming their business .
despite the hurry , everybody took notice of the architecture .
at night , the buildings glowed across the skyline .
the neon lights made things seem almost futuristic .
today was the day .

this one has very interesting mixture of curves and straight lines .
she thought this sculpture in the lobby area and how they did the room is very beautiful .

the family and i took a trip to the city and we stayed at this gorgeous house .

the city had some amazing buildings and great scenery .
we had dinner at a wonderful restaurant in location location .
when i decided to take a last minute mini-vacation i was n't sure how it would turn out , but from the first stop at i was enjoying myself .
i decided to flip a coin as i drove around the city and if it came up heads i stopped to check out whatever was close - like this school basketball court .
the ferris wheel was a city landmark and was lovingly maintained . it still ran despite its age .
i found a spot where i could get a higher vantage point and enjoyed the view despite the rain .
the city 's nightlife was n't thriving , but it still had its charm .
the school was new .
the grounds the school were on were vast .
kids liked to eat their meals outside .
the birds flew over the school often .
the city was glad to have such a modern school for the children .
i was really hungry at lunch one day .
after lunch i went back to my desk .
i was still hungry so i went back to grab more food .
i went to eat it at the park .
i had a great time there .

and then came inside to eat lunch .

the finale was impressive .
the town gathers for it 's annual 4th of july party .
we see a concert .

we tried to get to the concert early but there was still a large crowd there .
we were able to see everything due to the screen next to the stage . sempme started things off .
while there was an intermission , they played videos about the charity the concert benefited .
[male] [male] then got on and played a set .

we went on a trip to the city .
the lights were so beautiful in the evening
we got a little silly before going out to eat .
the restaurant was classy .
on the way home we took more selfies .
last night we ate at the most amazing reatuarant
we got a new camera and we decided to put it to good use .
we took some night shots that did n't come out so well .
next we tried taking a picture of a field but it came out blurry .
the only decent shot we got was this spiral window found on a church .
we checked out a really neat french restaurant , in location !
i took a lot of pictures with my new camera .
they even had the stoplight poles lit up .
the countryside was vast .
i saw some very interesting round windows .
my boyfriend and i went downtown last night for a photo shoot .
i took a photo of the street lights because they had this strange red glow on them .
my boyfriend and i took a photograph in the mirror together at a book store .
the book store sold my favorite book , 'moutaree . '
i took one last photo of myself before going back home .
for my photography class assignment , i took a picture of the front of my favorite restaurant .
other people in the class took pictures of themselves .
one of my favorite pieces was that of a stoplight .
another class favorite was one taken of a empty part at night .
but the best photograph of the class was one taken of a window at the top of a dome .
there were a lot of light bulbs .
i mean a ton a light bulbs !
there were so many , i needed to eat a hot dog !
that kid tried to steal it from me .
but the guy with the man purse beat him to it .
location lights at night are so beautiful .
even walking down a street at night is made extra special by all the lights .
it takes a lot of skill to make all of the lights look uniform .
we had to stop to get a quick photo together .
when we left we made sure to grab some sushi .
we visited this beautiful restaurant on our trip to location .
at night the village shops were all lit up .
th entrance to the restaurant was very bright , red and unique .
my girlfriend and i before we enjoyed a delicious authentic japanese sushi dinner .
the sushi was delicious , and plentiful !
lanterns decorate this restaurant .
see their intricate design .

the city has really evolved over the many years of it 's existence .
there are many new construction projects happening all the time .
the hispanic community has many small shops and businesses .
ultra modern buildings are springing up everywhere .
the new city is wonderful but the old still has it 's charm .
all over town today everything was silent .
we mourned the loss and murder of a little girl who was brutally murdered .
she was just 4 years old.snatched right out of her families yard.who would do such a thing ?
everything was quiet and you would hardly find a soul .
it is scary when one sits back and thinks that could have been my child , niece or cousin.what is coming to this world these days ?
our day exploring the city was fun . we rode bicycles around all of the landmarks .
this part of the city looked abandoned . there were actually lots of people around . just not in this shot .
the small specialty shops were fun to visit . we came back with too much stuff to carry on our bicycles .
cities have their own unique look , but i was missing the shade of trees in the concrete jungle .
some welcome shade in the city was just up ahead . we rode our bikes over to it to rest .
riding through the city on a nice day ,
the tour went very well .
stopped at a couple stores ,
before heading down town .
back home we go .
the buildings were tall
and they were very pretty .
they had shops
near glass buildings
and long streets .
they wanted to spend a lot of the time out there having fun , but they could n't believe their eyes with all of the statue .
she stopped to take a picture of her self over the railing in front of a large boat that was docked .
that evening they came into town and saw the very large ferries wheel and wanted to go on a ride .
they stopped to take a picture under a large kung fu statue .
she though the red high heels are a great thing to take a picture of .
the monument was at a fun sight to see .
the town enjoyed this monument .
the space needle was another well known monument .
the townpeople could see it from the ferris wheel .
[male] loved seeing his sights in the city .
the giraffe statue was even bigger up close .
the pier was busy , if beautiful , even on a cloudy day .
i could n't wait to get on the rides .
he really did try to be like the statue , but he might have been a bit too small .
then again , i probably could n't fit into the large shoes either .
our tour through the city started with me taking a picture under this metal giraffe .
we walked through the bridge , and took a picture overlooking the docks .
we passed by the small amusement park , and rode the ferris wheel .
afterwards we walked through an area with large sculptures , and took a picture under the robot .
we finally made it to the shoe store , where we took a picture of giant red shoes .
look at the wonderful piece of artwork that my husband is standing under .
there i am standing by the water with a ship in the background .
the ferris wheel ride was wonderful . i loved the view .
my husband acting like a super hero like the statue behind him .
there is no way i could ever fill those high heel shoes .
my family and i went to the location location location .
we took a train to get there to take in the sights .
my family had never rode in a train before and they were excited .
the train went on rails that were high in the air .
we arrived at the location location location after the train trip and enjoyed a great meal .
we went to the rainforest cafe this weekend and the fair around it .
there were many rides in the park , this carousel was awesome .
the monorail was very impressive , we could n't wait to ride it .
even though there was a long wait at the station it was worth it .
my only wish was that the weather was better .
we went to the location location .
in order to get there , we road the monorail .
it was quite empty .
the rail was very fast and it traveled across the water .
the cafe was on an island in the middle of the river .
birds were flying all over the place !
faster then a speeding bullet ? yes !
a quiet ride to our cabin .
i love trams , so much .

they are there to get the best view of the fireworks . what a gorgeous view .
we went to a family picnic at a nearby lake .
we all rode in a boat and tried to row .
we rowed for a while and it was a lot of fun .

this girl tried to talk us into trying her wares , but we had a lot more to see first .
the street vendors were very colorful here !
the red flag was very amazing .

our visit to the chinese festival was fun .
there were banners all around the city .
shopkeepers had lots of displays up and available for sale .

we went on a boat ride .
there were a lot of plants growing in the canal .
it was very beautiful .
we traveled into dense location wilderness . sometimes a boat or two would wander by .
we noticed the bright colors , and were hungry from a long day of work .
as soon as we approached , we smelled the great food , and paid the price .
they gave us one of the best meals i had in our stay in the location .
i remember this little bright boat fondly .
my brother is hungry , he is eating a big sandwich .
i have no idea what they put on top of our car .
there is a picture of the boat that we were on .
some of the weeds that grown alongside the creek and dock .
the water looks so calm and still .
the face [male] makes when biting into this huge sandwich at dinner on our trip .
these cars had these huge colorful piÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±atas on the top just driving along .
one of the highlights of the trip was a ride on these little boats .
the boats frequently stopped so we could see the surroundings .
the water was very clear and we could see many different types of fishes in it .
i visited a floating restaurant while on vacation .
it was a boat with a kitchen on it and you pulled your boat right up to it .
there was a man on board who was doing all of the cooking .
he had authentic local food being served .
it was a fun place and delicious and definitely something i would visit regularly if i was a local .
we watch the sunset on the last day of our vacation .
we are going to the boardwalk to ride the rides .
of course we will take time to win a prize .
if we can get lucky with the game that is .
at the end of the night we walk along the pier and say goodbye to our little dream spot .
one night at the beach we decided to take a walk .
we stood at the boardwalk watching the sunset .
we decided to take a walk on the pier .
the pier offered amusements like rides and food .
we loved our time in location !
we had a lovely day at the beach .
afterwards , we made a visit to the carnival .

we did n't win anything at the claw machine , though .
afterwards , we hung out at the boardwalk for a bit .
evening is the best time for the fair !
the ferris wheel looked specular all lit up
the arcade and concessions area was lotf of fun .
we played some pinball and video games for prizes .
at night we walked home , satisfied .
catching a sunset by the beach , on our way to the fair
looking at the sunset .
the fair is right by the beach .
about to get into the ferris wheel ride .
spotted a star on the deck .
i was house hunting for my dream home . i fell in love from the very first door knob .
the doors were beautifully molded .
the living space was open and decadent .
even the windows were fancy and serene .
i always wanted fancy molding ! this place will do perfectly .
i 've always been a fan of stained glass so when i found out about this building i had to go .
the glass door had some interesting painted glass shapes .
this window had beautiful flowers surrounded by yellow trim on the door .
this glass window is only a small portion of a larger window that was in the foyer .
the biggest surprise was the ceiling which had a larger version of the flowers i saw before .
[male] wanted to show the range of beauty that one could find in the use of glass . he too this shot to show it when it is plain and functional . even this shows a beauty of the reflection of nature .
his next example is a step upward as the glass is a central point of the design of the entire room .
the next step up shows the art of stained glass but it is at the simple end of artistry .
this is an even more beautiful and elegant piece of art .
finally , the most beautiful and elegant glass that he found that day shows the other end of the range of beauty of glass in the city .
we were told this home had the best window art in town .
we saw windows framed in beautiful wood .
we saw many stained glass windows .
some were on walls .
some were even mounted in the ceiling !
even the doorknobs displayed the elegance and style of the owners
the entrance gave both the impression of beauty and power .
each piece in the room was handpicked to evoke emotion from the visitors .
the stained glass was imported from around the world .
only the finest craftsman were employed to make even the smallest pieces of the house .
took the kids to a farm today . they have never been to one before .
here comes the pigs . they were so cute .
ah , baby chickens are even cuter . of course the kids wanted one .
oh yuck ... bees . like something out of a horror movie .
[male] rabbits . we have seen cuteness overload today .
today was the day .
the trip to the barn .
i saw some pigs .
a baby chick .
and a few bees !
we took the little one to the farm entry at the fair .
it was a pretty large building with a lot of pens and a lot of animals to see .
the baby chicks are always adorable .
the bees are awe inspiring , but a little scary .
the rabbits are cozy and cute . this one must have needed to cool off .
two best friends decided to go a barnyard petting zoo .
they first arrived and noticed a resting cow . they decided not to wake it .
next to the cow was a very cute pig that oinked every time the two girls came near the cage .
in small compartments over head there were cages filled with even cuter baby chicks .
the girls ended their day with the bee collection held in a separate house than the other animals . the girls put on bee suits and the swarm buzzed along the honeycomb .
my best friend turned into a farmer !
her name is [female] , so cute !
oink , oink . very friendly .
this little chick , tried to cross the road .
i was scared of getting stung .
my son was so cute at the park .
my daughter led him on the fun rides .
she is such a trooper . she rode the carousel twice .
my son clapped and watched the others .
my nephew wanted to ride in the boats before we left .
riding a roller coaster for the first time can be pretty scary !
this ride seems to be the children 's normal speed .
she seems very happy to be on this particular ride .
the young ones clap as the fairy ride flows by .
mom in the water boat looking bored .
dad and the kids had a fun outing today . a roller coaster started the day off for dad .

setting time aside for a vacation is important for everyone .
to explore a new region of the world and learn more about other people .
when traveling one can loose themselves in the culture that surrounds them .
they can also enjoy the local attractions .
they can also utilize the transit of the area to experience a side of the destination they could never see on foot .
we had to take a boat to get the the park .
it was along walk after we got off of the boat .
we found a group that was going , and they where kind enough to give us a lift .
after taking so long and so many different adventures to get to the park it was sadly a bit of a let down .
our boat was waiting on us when we got back to the dock . it was a nice sight to know we where on our way home .
today was the first day of our trip to location .

they stared down at the water and saw such an ugly fish they jumped .
standing on the pier above they decided to move on .
they headed to the gardens to see some flowers .

this is where i 'm headed to next .
i found others that spent their day the same way and were now ready to relax and enjoy the sunset .
have to get back on my way before it starts to get too dark .
our trip around the world took us to some fun places .
we took plenty of pictures , even of mundane things .
like this building , we just randomly took a picture of it .
it was great just being able to hang out with everyone in strange places .
it was especially fun just biking everywhere .
the man was looking out
near the house .
he was enjoying the sunet
and started biking
the entire night .
we went to a carnival last weekend .
there were gorgeous lights everywhere .
there was even an antique gas station .
the kids enjoyed the train ride .
i went on this train ride with my kids since it resembled a merry go round .
testing my new organization camera .
the close up quality shot of this horse is amazing .
i have taken a shot like this before . i love how the light bounces off the lens .
the camera comes with its own filter for black and white .
i try to get the most color in one shot . just to show off the camera .
the carousel was run down when we got it .
we fixed the lights .
we also fixed the gas pump next to it .
we added some new rides to it .
it took awhile but it was back up and running again within a few months .

they went to a bar .
then stopped to get gas .
then they went to a carnival for the kids .
the carousal is the best .
decided to get out of my hot downtown apartment and get some fresh air .
wandered by a little pizza shop , and got a snack . love these guys .
while walking after lunch , i noticed how many power lines are just above our heads . we forget to see it sometimes .
i wandered by a cat soaking up a few rays . kept thinking about getting my own kitty one day , maybe after i move .
the city life can be overwhelming , yet it teams with life , and curiosities .
today is a beautiful day .
i took a walk to go get some pizza .
this cat was laying on the side , he seem to be hot .
the pizza place seem to be crowded .
finally my favorite pizza has been served . this is the best pizza place ever and it fulfilled my day .
traveling around the city today .
we stopped in here for pizza ,
and walked down the streets ,
the weather was nice .
we walked around taking pictures all day .
a happy day was spent in the city .
a stop for homemade pizzas was made .
it was observed that the electrical wires were pretty against the sky .
a cat lounged on the road in the heat .
the cityscape was slightly claustrophobic but still fun .
the guy was walking
before he had some food .
the power lines were vast
and the cat was looking
at the power lines .
we went to the carnival this weekend , it was a great time .
they had a huge slide that we all enjoyed .
we also went on the ferris wheel , it was really high !
we did not neglect the other rides though , this one spun us so much we almost flew out .
i was almost too scared to go on the huge boat , but i did and it was awesome ! we 'll visit again soon .
took josh and the wife out to the fair .
he enjoyed some mean corn on the cob .
so did the wife .
i tried my hand at wack-a-mole .

i thought i was scary in my jack-o-lantern shirt .
my son rode the slide at the halloween fair .
there were ferris wheels and games .
i rode the tornado .
we finished with a ride on the viking ship .
my boyfriend and i went to an amusement park to celebrate halloween .
he was trying to convince me to get on this ride .
i told him we could compromise on the ferris wheel , but he felt it was not fast enough .
we ended up settling on this low key , yet fast ride .
he then went on this ride , all by himself .
my husband and our son went straight to the corn stand .
my son really devoured his corn on the cob !
it was a pretty tasty corn on the cob , i must admit !
my husband tried his hand at some games to try and win a prize for our son .
the outcome ? one huge stuffed animal for our son who was pretty happy !

about the band that was playing .
he had a good time through
crowdsurfing .

everyone feels like they are on top of each other .
then as it weeds out it is just you and your main competitor .
but at the end of the day we are all the same .
it 's time for the local balloon festival . there are so many colorful balloons .
they have to be careful not to get their balloons too close .
they launch into the sky and we watch from the ground in awe .
it is amazing that they can go so high .
one day we will get a chance to ride on a balloon too .
today we went to the hot air balloon festival .
two of the hot air balloons looked like they were going to collide , it was a little heart throbbing .
the balloons continued to rise up higher and higher .
eventually you could not see the balloon pilots they were so high .
in the twilight , this was my favorite balloon !
the family went to the hot air balloon festival .
we saw them all up close .
soon they all took off at the same time .
we saw them fly right over our heads .
all too soon they were landed and deflating .
we waited in eager anticipation for the race to begin .
at the starting gate , the contestants were bunched tightly
then , the field started to seperate and the race proceeded .
until the final two made it to the finish line
and aa winner was crowned after returning to earth .

the firework display was very elaborate and very bright .
there were all kinds of colors for the fireworks , even green .
after the fireworks was coming to an end , the lights turned to round yellow fireworks .

before the fireworks started .
the town was not all that interesting .
except for one statue .
there was also an interesting ride .
you could see it from the other side of this wall .
the wall has an important message .
i needed to go to the local butchery for some meat .
on my walk home , i decided to take the scenic route .
i came across the ferris wheel , but it was not operating due to the weather conditions .
i continued walking home on the road .
i came across a frog jumping on the organization pads .
i live in a pretty neat city .
they have lots of interesting things to look at .
we 've also got a organization wheel .
they have a take it if you need it box .
beside the take it if you need it box , the have a leave it box for donations .

just walking around parks was pretty relaxing .
the water was very tranquil .
we took a trip to a nearby spot in location .
there was a dancing fish that was made of metal .
there was even a ferris wheel .
there was also a giant purple wall .
there were many signs that said `` take it or leave it '' .
my friend was visiting me , so i decided to take him for tour of the area .
first , i showed him organization organization .
then i showed him him the american organization organization building .
afterwards , i took him up into the hills so he could see the view of the city , which spanned from side of the horizon ,
to the other . he was impressed !

we stopped by the capital building to enjoy a tour .
we eventually went hiking .

it was time for the show
many enjoyed the live music
and it lasted throughout the day
there were many different performers
and the show was a big hit
today was the day .
everyone was there .
so was the crowd .
the music was great .
it was epic .
have you ever been to a street festival ? i was at my first one last week , and i had such a blast .
i was able to listen to several groups of musicians who entertained the crowds for hours .
there were plenty of food tents and booths to feed both the musicians as well as the crowd .
it was nice to enjoy some cultural food for the first time and listen to music like this .
i was not the only one enjoying it , as the place was packed . i am going to attend this every year from now on !
drum roll please .
the best drummers around had assembled .
people came from miles around to hear them .
it was the first drummers contest .
what better place to have it than at the country fair ?
the drummers were playing
for many people .
they were at an event
and there were children there
that were very happy .
a day at the carnival is always exciting from my son . he loves to win prizes .
we get to see our whole family . there is uncle [male] on the left .
as the crowds thin we get ready to hit the rides .
the little one loves the fast spinny rides .
but i am a rollercoaster fanatic . tonight will be a night to remember .
two stuffed tigers hang on the tent , simply waiting to be picked up by a winner .
crowds of people stand at the fair and walk around .
the ride is packed with people ready to have a good time .
the cyber loop ride sits completely empty .
the coaster looks fun to many of the onlookers .
it was time for the carnaval cancun 2010 .
many people turned out to the event and the crowds were thick in the mid-way .
there were many different games to play and here , you can see the carousel .
this ride spins you around so fast and then puts you on a tilt . it 's pretty exciting !
they have a pretty cool roller coaster too , but it 's not too big .
this particular stand was selling various colors of plastic swords .
the turnout to the county fair was incredible .
a group of individuals were watching a player attempt to wind a prize .
the cyber loop was one of the most talked about ride .
the roller coaster with a very circular track .
the family went to the fair last night .
they had to walk close together since it was very crowded .
they stopped at a food truck for a snack .
then they rode on the cyber loop .
followed by a kiddie roller coaster .
my family was going on a trip .
so we went to the air port to get on a plane .
i got the window seat .
i could look out and see the ground below us .
from up above , i had this gut feeling i wanted to be back on the solid ground .
taking plane trips can be a lot of fun .
if you look out of the window you can see the clouds rolling in .
the towns below look so small when you are up so high .
getting off of the plane can wear you out a bit .
so sometimes it is good to stop , relax , and have a treat until you get your energy back .
we got to the airport and boarded our plane .
we saw some mountains as we flew over the land .
we looked down at the city we would be staying in .
we got off the plane at the airport and began exploring .
we decided first to go have some ice cream
i went on a trip to visit grandma .
i boarded a small jet .
the world looked so tiny from up here .
i spotted the area i lived in .
i saw the tip of a mountain from above .
the airport was vast
and the airplane was large
when it took off .
it went high up
and they could see the mountains .
the waterfall was breathtaking .
but we soon had to continue or journey down the narrow road .
finally we reached the village where we had to ring the large bell to be let in .
the villager sent a boy to meet us at the entrance and lead us inside .
we were then brought to the path that lead to the sacred park .
[male] and his buddy visiting a waterfall nearby their house .
he took lots of pictures of its beauty .
they really loved it the waterfall .
the sun peaked over the clouds after a while .
[male] goes back home and shows his family his pictures .
the ride to the temple offered beautiful sights , too .
but once we got past the waterfalls , it was a straight road ahead .
the bell was so much bigger than i 'd expected it .
the temple itself was large too and very beautiful .
one last look reminded me how much work had gone into the walkway .
me and a buddy took a trip out to see a famous waterfall .
we took many pictures .
the waterfall was falling in full force today .
the weather was nice and not too hto .
we saw many old buildings along the way .
i went to location for vacation . i saw a beautiful waterfall .
mist filled the air as we drove back to the hotel .
this bell was charming .
architecture like this shows the greatness of the country .
this walkway was so neatly laid out that i had to take a picture of it .
today was the day .
the trip to the temple .
it was beautiful .
so much to see .
so much history .
the family went to the carnival .
then they went on a tour of the city .
it included art and architecture .
this building was one of the main points .
it has a lot of history .
while sightseeing , we managed to get some great photo opportunities . a ferris wheel backdrop always works !
what is this great architecture ? it takes our breath away .
the old builders were definitely masters at their craft .
this appears to be a tomb , but being unsure , we did n't enter .
the architecture on this structure is fantastic . it looms over head .
we took plenty of pictures of beautiful buildings while on vacation .
here 's one from the side , such beautiful detail .
the amount of detail in the buildings amazed all who looked at them .
against the backdrop of the sky the building looks glowing .
such a tall building with intrinsic details
the temples were truly breathtaking .
the fact that these have been built for so long was just unbelievable .
how could such beautiful buildings be made ?
it was truly baffling to think about their creation .
the design was wonderful .
i was hungry , so i started walking to find a place to eat .
i crossed the bridge .
i ended up in location location .
i got distracted and went shopping at location location .
i finally ended up finding sushi to eat .
i went to work today .
i could see the old houses down in the river .
i had a great time at the capitol .
after work i was pretty hungry .
i went to get some sushi .
we got on the bridge during rush hour .
it took a long time to finally cross .
we decided to stop off in china town to eat .
we found a good looking place and went inside .
we ordered our food and enjoyed it .
i had heard that the best sushi in the city was in location location 's historical location town .
it was terribly foggy that day as i crossed the golden gate bridge .
but it cleared up once i finally made it to location town .
what a colorful building i bet their sushi will be fabulous !
a nice korean beer , some miso soup , and a wonderful sushi roll made for a wonderful day .
it often surprised people who had never been to learn that the location location location was n't actually gold .
of course no one believes it made of gold but the color is n't gold , its red .
it leads you into one of the most fascinating cities in the location location .
full of culture .
and great food . especially excellent sushi .
the fireworks were amazing .

we rode the [female] eye . what a great ride !
their version of a farmer 's market held all sorts of great fruits and veggies .

our favorite thing to do is watch the waves splash on the shore .
and wonder just exactly what they built the building for .
our trip to the lake was pleasant .
we saw old windmills
and farming machinery .
we even saw a lighthouse
which was made of marble .
we went to the farmland for a little while to escape the city .

our road trip was long and we had a long way to go .
we took a walk on the nature trail today .

the trail went on for so long !
we had to take a rest , and look out for mountain lions !
we had a great time and it was such a beautiful day !
some tourist were sightseeing and noticed a lovely flower .
one of the tourist saw a sign about a mountain lion and thought it would much more exciting than flowers .
the tourists followed the road up looking for the mountain lion but never saw it .
soon , the group reached a dead end and they knew that there were no mountain lions this way up the road .
they looked back at the long road they traveled to see the lion , and they both agreed to look at more beautiful flowers on the way back .
when the family first drove into the park , they saw a sign with directions on where to go .
at the side of the road there were beautiful flowers everywhere .
they drove up a long winding path to another area of the park .
there was a pavilion that had a sign that said to watch out for mountain lions .
they kept going up the mountain until they got to the very top . the view was magnificent .
this is where i live . i sleep when and where i please and live off the land .
i know this place inside and out . i appreciate the beauty nature offers .
this is one of my favorite places to prowl . it 's great for people stalking ... i mean watching .
recently , men put up these things . i like the drawing at the top of the sign but the rest is gibberish .
that 's my favorite bush i spend a lot of time hidden here sleeping or enjoying all the tasty scents . be sure and slow down when you walk by here so i can stop and say rawwrrr !

went to an art museum with a group of friends .
we were looking for some artwork to purchase.as sometimes artist allow the sales of their items .
there were pictures of all sorts , but in front of them were sculptures or arrangements of some sort .
some were far out there or just far fetched .
then there were others that were more down to earth and stylish.this set was by far my favorite.very beautiful to me .
i was looking forward to our museum trip even though i do n't understand some of the art like this sculpture .
this is another one that i did not understand but my friend loved it .
i liked this ; it looks like what fireworks would look like if you could freeze them .
this was my favorite piece at the museum today .
[female] 's favorite was this vase that she really wished she could take home .
amazing night at the art gallery with my date .
we could n't quite tell what this art was , however , it was unique .

a young couple went to the amusement park and rode on the bumper cars .
while they were looking for another ride , they ran into their friends .
they rode on the water boat ride next .
they were at the end of the park now and needed to get back to the exit .
they took the skyline ride back to the front of the park and went home .
the bumper car was fast and swift .
i took a picture with my family after the ride .
they caught a good picture of me smiling .
the theme park was really interesting .
my favorite part was the ride that was somewhat like a ski lift .
kimmy had a blast on the rides today .
taking a break from the busy park .
kimmy is all smiles as we enter the amusement park
look at all the rides we have to ride today .
last ride of the day , then it 's homeward bound .

what a fun day with friends .
spending time with her friends always made her happy .
now they were going to ride the big roller coaster .
then it would be off to the stands .
the father took his little boy to see the beautiful hot air balloons .
off , in the air the flew away , they were beautiful every one wanted to see .
the little boy ran up and down the railing looking and screaming in enjoyment .
he tried to sneak through the bars to touch one .
after he had realized he could not make it through the bars he tried to pull him self up and over the bars instead .
balloon stampede in location location location . what could be a better family event ?
we watched in early morning hours as the balloons filled with hot air .
my kid was amazed at how big and bright the balloons were .
later , our kid made a run for it , and thought perhaps freedom was just a balloon basket away .
and yes , our kid was too quick for us . he ended up flying away in the red and yellow balloon . we miss him .
i 'm glad i got there early enough to see the balloons being readied .
some took off before others .
i loved seeing how happy [male] was as they all began to rise .
he wanted to get closer and moved completely against the fence .
when it was over , it was hard to pry him away .
the hot air balloons were just starting to get set up when we got there .
we watched as they started to slowly fly into the sky .
my son was captivated by them .
he tried to climb the fence to ride one .
he could only barely get his head above the fence bars .
i took my son to see the annual hot air balloon event .
he stared in amazement at all the hot air balloons .
he pointed out the balloon he thought looked a coolest .
he wanted to take a closer look , but the gates kept us out .
so i held him up on my shoulders to get a good view of all the hot air balloons taking off into the sky .
one of the recent hurricanes ruined the old pier .
a closer view of the end of the ruined pier .
a stronger pier that stood up to the hurricane farther down the beach .
a roller coaster right near the strong pier .
there was a huge seafood selection in the shops near the pier .
location location is my favorite place .
i always go to the carousel first .
then i like to ride the roller coasters .
afterwards i like to gets something to eat from the fish stand .
the last thing i do is spend some time at the beach before heading home .
[male] was on vacation at the beach and spotted a structure in the water .
it looked like it could be the skeleton of an amusement park ride .
he sat on the beach , looking at the boardwalk and imagined what it once was .
later he visited the boardwalk and rode a real amusement park ride - the turbo coaster !
afterwards he ate fresh seafood for dinner from one of the vendors on the boardwalk .
it 's a day at the beach and the weather is fine .
the waves are barely breaking on the shore line .
there 's a pier there in the distance .
the turbo coaster tempts people 's tolerance of fear .
some healthy looking snack offerings present themselves .
we walked down to the beach .
we noticed a large building in the water .
then we saw a large pier that went far into the ocean .
after that we passed by a scary roller coaster .

some of them were amazing .
i had a great time there .
the trees were lit with fantastic colors at the park .
the blue lights on the ground paired well with the lit trees .
the tee landscape and lit trees were breathtaking .
another view of the lit up trees on a cold winter night .
the lights were lit in the rock bed near the walkway .
i took a walk to see the city christmas lights .
this was one of my favorite displays . i love the blue lights covering the ground .
the lights were beautiful as they lined the road .
i also went to the nearby park to see the decorations there .
a soothing fountain was at the center of the park .
my neighborhood always has amazing lights during the holidays .
this yard was one of the best ones because of how the trees lit up .
this was another great one with the lights strung up and the different colors in the trees .
this was our favorite because the trees were huge and the lights made them stand out .
these lights added a touch of flair as they stood out in the stones .
i went to see christmas light display .
all of the trees were decorated .
there were strings of lights all across the sky .
there were even some platforms where you could view lights from above .
these lights looked like city lights .
tonight we are celebrating the local festival of lights .
there is a very large group waiting to get inside the temple .
inside the temple it is quite chaotic as everyone gets ready for the parade .
the dragon is everyone 's favorite part of the parade .
the most important thing is to remember to light a candle for good luck .
when we arrived to the ceremony hall , the sky overhead looked amazing .
we stood outside to watch the new year 's parade .
inside , there were food and refreshments for everyone .
the candles were lit for the ceremony .
this was the stage where the ceremony took place ; it was a wonderful evening .
everyone gathers at the house to celebrate .
a large dragon parades about during the festivities .
the guests eat delicious foods .
everyone lights a candle in the celebration .
finally , people gaze at the shrine before the night is over .
last spring i went to another country for vacation .
there were so many tourists there .
it almost felt like i was back home .
there were some great shows put on with dancing dragons .
we all took turns lighting candles .
the temple was lit up for the evening festival .
chinese dragons moved through the crowds near the temple .
the markets were lit up and had food and drink for sale .
inside the temple the candles were all lit .
the shrine made an impressive centerpiece .
[male] loves to play volleyball , so he has set up a short game with his brother [male] .
as they hit a few back and forth they had a lot of fun .
sometimes it is hard to reach the ball .
some people even fall down while trying to make it over the net .
it is pretty awesome for family to watch and root [male] and his brother on .
[male] likes to be a showoff when we get together for a friendly game of volleyball in the park .
[male] knows this and so he always tries to put [male] in his place by doing something more impressive .
cal on the other hand spends this time practicing his serve for the big match .
in the end it 's always location and [male] who play the hardest and the smartest at the net .
after it 's all said and done all of our wives steal the show anyway .
my brother at the picnic having fun .
volleyball time is coming to a brutal game .
he saved the ball from hitting the ground .
after hitting the ball , he ended up tripping .
a group of us standing around talking .
the family get together was a load of fun .
we went to a local park and played volleyball .
there was no foul play that day .
just a lot of quality volleyball .
some people chose to watch instead of play .
the family was enjoying a picnic .
they played a lot of sports .
they had a big game of volleyball going on .
the team on the right was winning .
time to eat !
the display started with a single firework .
then one that looked like a flower .
then two together .
then 3 fireworks at a time .
then the display slowed down and went back to 2 fireworks .
it was the fourth and time for fireworks .
this is my favorite time of year .
i love watching all the colorful fireworks .
they all came out so pretty this year .
i ca n't wait for the fourth already , so excited for next year .
fireworks usually a sign of celebration .
in the location location , fireworks are traditionally used in two occasions :
the 4th of july , also known as independence day ,
and new years .
regardless of the celebration , fireworks are fun to look at .
went to see the fireworks show in location location last night it was awesome .
see how they look like flowers . i love watching these .
my favorite are these double fireworks and the finale .
what a splash . looks like bombs of electricity .
look at the pretty colors exploding in the sky . almost time for the finale .
the fireworks were purple
and very large .
they were blue
and had all kinds of blasts
that were many colors .
a couple went on a date to the amusement park .
they rode on the ferris wheel .
they also rode on the carousal
they bought a souvenir so they could remember their date .
the park was beginning to close because it was getting late , so they left .
we decided to go to the fair this weekend .
there were so many rides to choose from .
this is my favorite statue , one of the famous duck .
i even got to ride the biggest ride they have .
all in all it was a fantastic time .
an important part of going to the carnival is to try your luck at the various games to win a prize .
for other excitement , you can try your nerve and get on a ride .
if you are into a more relaxed riding experience you can hop aboard a pony at the merry-go-round .
to capture your experience it 's always a good idea to grab a souveneir .
at the end of the night , you get a much needed rest and enjoy the buzz of a carnival .
the carnival at night was a lovely affair .
all along the main strip , rides and games were open for enjoying .
the carousel horses were intricately painted .
souvenirs were available for anyone that wanted to buy a lasting memory .
from outside , the artwork of the festival 's lighting drew the attentions of all nearby .
all the children in town are waiting to go to the fair .
the wonder wheel is always one of the major attractions .
little kids love to ride the merry-go-round .
everybody gets a small souvenir to take back home .
every summer the fair brings lights , colors and joy into town .
with the political unrest in location , there are a few groups organizing to be heard .
this summer 's festival showed us the bright colors of asian culture .
location flags flying high , waving with passion and recognition .
there are many in need of help , and a request to be seen .
i 'm proud these people can share their unrest with free speech in this country !
yanyan is fiercely proud of her tibetan culture .
just thinking about it makes her speechless .
her mom has always taught her to be a proud tibetan and encourages her to stand up and support them .
so they went to a demonstration to prove that they were supportive .
they were there all night and really felt like they made a difference .
everybody was ready to protest .
you could tell how passionate they all were .
signs were held up all throughout the day .
some signs were larger than the others .
the protest lasted long , long into the night .
many people came to the protests .
they came dressed up in tibetan colors .
they waved tibetan flags .
they carried signs to free location .
the protest lasted well into the night .
i joined a rally last week .
it was really colorful and almost looked like a parade .
we held our flags in pride .
we marched to free location .
i hope we made a difference .
[male] took his daughter to the town fair for her birthday .
they rode the bumber cars together and had a ball .
[male] 's was elated when she rode the giant swings .
there was even a huge castle that [male] 's daughter got to go through .
after all of the fun at the fair they went and got a burger and went home for the night .
the lowenbrau building had many interesting characters .
the hamburger was take a little too literally here .
the building was lit up beautifully with the decor .
th pink display fit in perfect at the fair .
the swinging ride was lit up beautifully at night .
my family and i went to a carnival .
we had so much fun on the spinning rides .
this was my favorite ride , it was so fun !
we waited while the kids went on this ride .
at the end of the day we went to this cute restaurant .
our date night at the fair was awesome .
i felt like a kid when we took a spin on the bumper cars .
my boyfriend wanted to ride that , but i decided i wanted to live .
the entrance to the fair was so much grander than i expected .
at the end of the night , we stopped to my favorite burger joint for dinner .
the park is busy and packed with people today .
the rides are super fast i can barely get a picture in time .
the rides looks awesome lit up at nights .
i love this picture and all the different colors .
what an unusual sign this place has .
there were a ton of rides at the fair .
i had a great time there .
some of them looked very dangerous .
the ferris wheel was huge .
the place was amazing .
we went on so many fun rides at the amusement park .
there was the giant swing ride that made everyone nauseated .
the flying ship was thrilling .
bumper cars were fun but i started to regret the number of corn dogs i had eaten .
we capped the day off with a ride on the organization wheel .
we went to the carnival just for the ride that makes you feel like you 're falling from a sky scraper .
we rode some other rides too , including the high swings .
there were several rides , including one that looked like a rocket ship taking off .
the ferris wheel was so beautiful all lit up at night .
we rode the swings ride again so we could see all the lights at night .
those are my adventurous children on that park ride .
i get motion sickness so i happily sat back and took pictures .
i got dizzy just watching this one .
here 's my favorite - the ferris wheel . i 'm not afraid of heights .
my kids love this ride enough to go on it again .
well , it certainly looked scary enough .
that 's what they came for .
thrills .
the largest ferris wheel they had ever seen should be an adventure .
she remembered when she had thought the swings were scary and wondered if she would become desensitized to the other rides .
it was the annual oktober fest .
there were peanuts being sold .
there were also many carnival rides .
there was also cotton candy for sale .
the crowd gathered to have dinner at the festival .
every year the smith family has one special weekend that they really look forward to .
that is the oktober festival every [male] .
there is a variety of delicious foods and drinks .
they go on all of the rides even though they are stuffed on fried food .
and they always end the night with drinking and dancing .
today the community celebrates together at the annual `` oktober fest . ''
they have a bunch of good food .
they have fun rides
and they have cotton candy . what more could one want ?
overall , the day is a great day to spend with friends and family .
i love octoberfest . i had to travel all the way to location just for this .
roasted nuts ? these taste so good .
i will not be getting on that but i will be getting myself a beer .
or i 'll be getting myself a cotton candy which is almost as good as beer .
here is a place where you will get hit in the head with a soft toy hammer , it 's great fun and it 's done for a fun time .
it is oktoberfest !
there is food !
and rides !
and more food !
but mostly , there is beer !
i prepared the hot air balloon .
we were going to take a ride across the country .
it was a lot of fun .
the view was spectacular .
i ca n't wait to go again .
hot air balloons are great , and a wonderful way to see the country side . so last vacation , we took one .
going up in one can be a little nerve wracking unless you are used to it .
but once you are up , the view you get is incredible .
and unlike a plane , you get to take your time and look at everything . a real birds eye view .
if you have never taken a balloon trip , i recommend it . we loved it .
a real american balloon ,
was risen in the air tonight ,
and we got to travel in it .
the view was magnificent .
we had a great time .
balloon enthusiasts prepared to lift off by inspecting their balloon .
once off , the view of the takeoff area became very beautiful .
from above , the balloon looked bright and beautiful .
the countryside was a blanket of greens and golds .
as the crew rose higher , they considered themselves lucky to have such a grand view .
what a great way to spend your evening , on an air balloon !
check out the view ! and we are n't even that high yet !
this is also the most american hot air balloon to boot .
we were so high up now i started to get a little queasy .
though i did n't feel too good the view was just out of this world !
the realtor told us the housing was in great shape ...
well , it was obvious that was a lie .
broken windows , painted columns , messed up floors ... .
those are just a few of the things we encountered ...
when viewing the house .
we decided to repaint the building .
painting the tile would be a challenge .
we decided to walk through the halls to see what else needed to be painted .
it looked like some of the lines need repainting .
there was also a warehouse area that needed painting .
the abandoned building was super creepy , especially in the bathroom .
there were busted out windows .
paint could be seen splattered on the walls .
the walls also looked to be cracked in some places .
previous residents left behind hand prints on the concrete .
we took a look inside the empty building .
the walls where freshly painted and in good structure .
we walked down the empty halls .
it felt kind of creepy at times .
so , we decided to make our way out through the back .
the bathroom was clean
but the windows were not .
the room needed to be redone
and there was tape on the walls
along with handprints .
today was the day .
the trip to the fair .
there was a wheel .
and [male] duck .
did i mention the wheel ?
fall had begun .
but it did not keep the people from coming to the fair .
they rode the ferris wheel all day .
they also rode the swings .
but in the end it was the corn maze that was the most fun .
went to the halloween carnival in location today .
i 've been going to this for years and today i got on this ferris wheel .
wow , this thing looks way too scary . it looks like a transformer throwing people around .
a giant rock this belongs in our city and ads life to this halloween carnival .
prize winning pumpkins . i should have brought one .
there was a pumpkin competition at the fair this year .
it was busy , but not too crowded to get around easily .
the ferris wheel was very colorful .
some people were really brave on some of the rides . i do n't think i could handle some of them .
there was also a corn maze nearby that we went through .
it was time fo the fall festival .
everyone in town was out enjoying the nice cool air .
the ferris wheel was a popular ride .
the slinger was also equally fun .
the corn maze was fun for the kids to get lost in .
it is time for us to go to the local star wars convention .
this is a picture of our best friend in front of the roller coaster .
we are going to the carnival tomorrow .
tonight we are celebrating with friends at a local restaurant .
there is nothing more exciting then going to a convention with your friends and enjoying yourselves .
we all decided that we would check out the new theme park .
at first we were disappointed by the surroundings .
our feeling changed when we ran into some cosplay characters .
later on we went out to eat with friends .
we finished the night with dancing at a nearby club .
[male] and his friends went to an amusement park .
they walked around and enjoyed the sites .
they dressed up as star wars characters for a special photo .
they enjoyed a fabulous meal after .
they ended the night with dancing .
we enjoyed dressing up as our favorite star wars characters .
then , we took a relaxing walk .
we took a ride up high .
we had dinner .
we ended the night with a few drinks .
my friends and i went to a theme park yesterday .
it 's halloween so the trees at the park are pretty bare .
we saw some people dressed up in star wars costumes for halloween .
after the theme park we went to a chinese restaurant .
and by the end of the night we were tired and had quite a few drinks .
the group took a trip to location . they saw a lot of local architecture .
they also went down a beautiful street filled with lanterns .
they also saw some carvings that locals had made .
they also sampled some local cuisine .
after that it was a call home to check on the family .
the asian center was full of culture .
famous icons were present in the form of statues .
food was abundant .
the young especially like to hang here .
the decor was bright and inviting .
we celebrated chinese new year in location .
i love the floating lanterns .
dragons were everywhere .
this was some kind of strange live food .
they still have pay phones in location !
yesterday was chinese new year .
we saw lots of dragons .
we had food from street vendors .
we stopped by a temple .
everything was lit by red paper lamps .
the class went on a field trip to location location today . first we saw an alter for prayer .
the children loved the big dragon on the street .
we ate some pot stickers for lunch .
the kids walked through a museum and stopped for pictures every chance they got .
the sky of the streets in location location are filled with red paper lanterns .
i decided to spend the weekend with good friends and family .
these are some of my cousins .
my family and i are very close .
we even went to location location for the day .
it has the best roller coasters to ride on .
they planned out what they wanted to do on the map .
it would be a long day of walking .
they roller coasters were the best they had every seen .
this roller coaster made them dizzy .
there was time for one last ride before the park closed .
he was in great mood today .
his darling little daughter was with him .
and the love of his life .
a day at the amusement part should be fun .
too bad they could n't ride the roller coaster .
girls are sitting down and quietly enjoying an amusement park together .
other people prefer to walk around the park and seek entertainment where they can find it .
one of the main attractions is a huge rollercoaster .
the rollercoaster has plenty of loops and twists .
in the evening , the rollercoaster becomes a different kind of skyscraper .
the guy did not know what to think
but his daughter was taking a photo .
she smiled
as they were about to ride
the big rollercoaster .
[male] was practicing with his new camera and taking night shots .
by accident he moved the camera while it was capturing the lights .
so he decided to mess around and make some unique photos .
this is actually cars driving down a main street in town .
this one is near a bridge with overhead lights .
i just bought a new lens and wanted to try it out on lights .
i found that the moving lights created spectacular imagery .
i moved the tripod and camera to a new spot and found even more beautiful shots .
i somehow added a black streak and it amplified the imagery .
this was the last shot of the night , i thought it was perfect .
the lights started ,
going off in different directions .
a great combination ,
of red and yellow .
the visual was rather interesting .
in photography , there are different kinds of tricks for certain effects .
some tricks let you capture light at a slow rate to see the movement of light .
this kind of trick lets you see all the different ways the light has moved .
whether the light moves straight forward or bends and waves , the camera will capture it .
using this kind of technique will produce an affect reminiscent of fireworks .
the fireworks were bright
and had orange colors .
they were also red
and yellow
and in many streaks .
the carnival has a wheel .
the elephant states were everywhere .
there was a blue statue .
there was a yellow and green statue .
this one was multi colored .
during our trip to location , we saw some art pieces next to the street . they were elephants painted in different ways !
there were simple ones , like a blue one .
then there more fancier ones , such as the one painted with tree leaves on it .
others were extremely fancy , with lots of abstract designs .
one had what appeared to be pictures of various tropical scenes painted on it . it was very cheerful !
the annual parade of elephants is awesome ,
look at this crazy blue elephant with one eye .
and now we have the kudzu elephant .
next is the elephant of all nations .
this elephant is supposed to look like a montage .
this is a sight we were n't expecting to see in location .
these are hand painted elephants .
they are available to purchase .
the proceeds go to an elephant rescue .
i would 've loved to buy one but they 're too big for the plane ride home .
the family was vacationing .
they want on a art tour around the city .
they saw a collection of elephants .
they were made of clay .
then they were painted .
location location is a prime example of a thrill seeking amusement park . a guest can expect to be entertained here .
one of the highlight attractions is a roller coaster that simulates a motorcycle ride , something unlike any other theme park attraction .
this thrill ride tests a rider 's fear of heights !
no thrilling amusement park would be complete without a roller coaster that does loops .
and if a guest wants to cool off after waiting in line for the roller coasters , the attached water park is another example of thrilling heights and speeds .
a group of friends went to the amusement park .
they rode on one of the roller coasters .
they rode on the ferris wheel .
they got hot , so they headed over to the water park .
after they were cooled down , they went on more rides .
we were so excited to be at the amusement park !
we rode all the best rides first .
i love the rides that flip you unpside down .
we zoomed along over and over again .
then we hit the water park area . what a fun day !
it was time to go to the amusement park !
we started off my going on this rollercoaster .
then we went on this crazy tilting spinning ride .
then another rollercoaster .
followed by this giant water slide . great day at the amusement park .
we spent the day at the amusement park .
the kids were so scared to go on the roller coaster , once they got off though they wanted to go again .
the girls favorite ride was the huge ferris wheel
the boy loved the big waterslide .
we all loved the roller coasters .
the kids eyeballed the largest rollercoaster on the way into the park .
i watched as they continued to watch it on our journey .
however , nothing will ever replace the look on their faces ...
when they were actually inside those seats and ...
flipping , turning and moving upside down .
we got to the theme park during the afternoon .
i noticed the rollercoaster first and had to make it my first destination .
once i was on the ride i had a slight change of heart .
but it was to late !
all i could do was look down and consider all the ways this could go wrong .
i was scared as we approached the rollercoaster .
i saw people going down it .
some people looked scared .
i heard people screaming .
i was terrified as i got strapped in .
an important part of the summer is taking a trip to the local theme park .
the thrill of letting yourself dive , twist and turn on rides makes us feel more alive .
the people who are waiting their turn see the excitement in the eyes of the riders adding to their anticipation .
while on a ride a person has complete ability to let go and enjoy the moment .
the look on the faces will always be the lasting impression of how successful a summer trip to the park was .
i came to knott 's berry farm today just to get on this ride . i 'm scared
here we go , up , and down and up and down .
not so bad , kinda exciting .
woooooahhhh ! ! !
is it over yet ?
i 've always loved boats .
i love big boats .
i really love small boats too .
i love to watch them .
so , piloting a boat was a big deal for me .
i love to go see the boats in the harbor .
there are many different kinds of boats .
they look so majestic in the water .
there are even newer model boats that look so fancy .
i always have such a good time down here !
we came across this ship on our day out and decided to climb aboard .
the mast is way higher than you 'd think ! got ta catch the wind !
you can see the sheer size compared to the surrounding boats .
this ship is a beautiful piece of architecture .
the wood grains and decor make it a cozy ship too !
the boat tours were quite interesting to say the least .
it was weird being on a boat that had n't been used in a long while .
the boats were beautiful however .
they were a popular place for other people to come to as well .
the woodwork was incredible to look at .
dad had been a sailor .
not in the organization , he was a sailor by profession .
now it was in his blood as well .
he loved everything about it .
he was in charge .
there is a concert tonight at a fair .
the guitarists are putting on a good show for the local crowd .
at the fair there are things to do and play .
the lights at the fair are bright and inviting .
the fair has a light show that is free of charge that many people come out to see .
just another heavy metal dream , went to the riverfront festival for summer !
the music was ripe and hot , and much dancing was being had !
the night rolled in , a few beers had been had , and the carousel shone bright with lights and colors .
in location state , we smoked a little marijuana , and watched the carousel spin slowly . wild man , wild .
as we left , we noticed the lights shone red , ominous , telling us it was our time to exit .
i was hired to take a photos of this band playing at the county fair .
the show was fantastic and there even was an encore .
there was even time left in the evening to enjoy the rides .
i got to ride a horse even !
the dome around the geodesic dome exhibit was all lit up .
the music this night was grand .
the guitarist looked like he was happy , he was going to throw his guitar .
the sunset was magnificent .
they decided to ride the ride as the sun went down .
the lights of the dome were calming for them to look at .
the man was singing
and another was playing guitar
as the rides were starting .
the ride lit up
and was pretty in the night .
we went to see the amusement park at the chinese temple this week .
they had some interesting rides !
the atmosphere was amazing and we enjoyed it .
the lights were breathtaking and we could stare at them for hours .
even the temple was lit up from the top to bottom !
it is chinese new year !
we always go to town to ring in the new year .
the city looks so beautiful with all the lights .
it is amazing being here at night .
i had such a great time . happy new year !
we enjoyed the neon lights of the pagoda . very festive !
there are always rides at any festival and this was no exception .
this appears to be a lighted willow tree . fantastic art !
the lighted pagoda from a distance was awe inspiring .
this local gentleman was part of the festival , and looked happy to be there !
it was the holiday season in the city .
the city was filled with lights .
the decorations were big and plentiful .
the celebration was brilliant .
it was truly a magical time .
the japanese fair is always fun .
look at this spinning ride .
the streets are lit up so nice .
and you can go up on a lit boat ride at night .
the whole city gets decorated for this !
today is our tour of the local flower garden . the fountain is still when the birds drink from it .
inside the garden we are met by lots of different varieties of flowers .
this is the most interesting shaped one so far .
we wish we could grow specimens like these in our garden .
as we leave we look at the cherry blossoms and say goodbye .
we took a trip to see the city of arches .
my mom is striking a pose underneath an arch .
the next day we decide to go out by the water and see the sites . first we had to enter the area through a long hallway .
here is me and my sister posing in front of the metal statue on the pier .
a trip to see the golden globe was the last stop for the day .
spending the day in the park , i see two birds perched on the stone ledge in front of a pond .
strange looking figures appear by the trees along the path .
a weird looking but interesting flower grows along the trees .
i bend down to take a picture of a pretty lilac flower on the ground .
i look up to see a group of [female] blossoms along the path .
the family visited a beautiful garden for the day .
they found interesting sculptures near the flowers .
they pointed out interesting and unusual flowers to each other .
they found an orchid shaped like a heart .
they decided to picnic under a cherry blossom tree .
i went to the park today to take some photographs , first i photographed some ducks .
as i was walking , i noticed these strange flowers hanging in the trees that looked like ghosts .
next i photographed a beautiful yellow , green and orange flower , i 've never seen one like it .
the park was full of beautiful purple orchids .
and the cherry blossom trees were fully in bloom
at the zoo we went to the room with all the great jelly fish .
one the way out i saw a ferries wheel up in the distance and i instantly wanted to ride it .
after i had the ride i decided to flamingo , they were very pretty .
the polar bears were such a great thing to see , so great and strong .
the panda bear at the zoo seemed very reclusive and stayed far away .
i went to the fair last week .
after the fair i went for a walk .
i visited the local monuments .
i went back to the bridge .
afterward i went to visit the zoo .
there was a jellyfish exhibit at the zoo
they also had a ferris wheel .
under the wheel were the flamingos .
there was a polar bear .
the panda looked lonely .
there were lots of interesting water creatures to see
we even got to have fun on the huge ferris wheel
on our way , we even got to stop and see the flamingos !
looks like it was the polar bears time for a bath .
and last we got to see the little panda taking his nap .
the park 's zoo now has a sea life exhibit . here 's a beautiful jellyfish .
i could see the park ferris wheel from the zoo .
the flamingos were so peaceful and elegant .
the polar kept pacing back and forth in his enclosure .
i read that this panda might be pregnant . ca n't wait to see her baby .
this is [male] and [female] who have been together for 5 years .
[male] wants to propose to her at 4:30 because they met in front of this clock tower at that time .
afterwards he wants to take her on this ferris wheel to celebrate .
he would like to have the ceremony here .
[female] has said many times this would be her dream place for a wedding .
location is a wonderful place to sight see .
i had seen the location eye on tv and in movies , but it is much more impressive in real life .
and the location location is just absolutely beautiful .
we had to go back to the eye to catch this shot just at sunset .
and we also got to catch the fading rays of the sun bouncing off organization organization .
while on vacation in location , we got to see big [male] .
we also got to see the [female] eye . beautiful man made structure at sunset .
location in the coming twilight is very pretty .
the [female] eye with the setting sun behind it is fantastic .
the old english architecture is something to behold .
we moved along the city starting at big [male] .
we walked around the river and looked at the ferris wheel .
the city itself was amazing .
but i was intrigued by the ferris wheel , it was much bigger then i thought it would be .
we continued on , passing a few state buildings .
it 's a quiet evening in location .
big [male] silently tells the time in a clear sky .
other landmarks stand tall as the sun slowly fades into twilight .
the weather is clear and provides a wide view .
in other places , landmarks are visible from the shelter of trees .
i stopped in a small town on my road trip .
there were many statues there .
the hotel was very nice .
i saw lot of historic landmarks .
the courthouse was very impressive .
the statue was holy .
the church has interesting windows .
the cross on the top o the church really inspired .
organization was a cool company .
this building was also interesting .
historical cities are very interesting places .
the sculptures and gardens around this city are very peaceful .
the buildings are unique and reflect a rich history .
the architecture of the city is artsy
and regal . you do n't see much of that being made anymore .
this historical place ,

and many other items .
the garden was a treat ,
so we stayed outside for some time .
site seeing in the downtown over the weekend .
statues in the park .
taking photos of the local buildings .

[female] looked out of her window on the plane , excited for her big trip .
even the plane wings looked foreign and beautiful .
the airport was equally stunning .
she walked the street trying to find her hotel .
she settled in for the night tired but excited for her day tomorrow .
we headed off on our plane ride to our vacation .
the interior sky dome in this location was amazing .
the old historic buildings were filled with character .
the large church seemed to be glowing just before dawn .
the downtown streets were lined with people enjoying themselves .
beautiful sun set as we landed .
the first place we went to see was the government building with the glass dome ceiling .
outside , the square was a good size square .
we then went to see the famous church .
the inside was huge .
on my way to location .
i love to fly but can not look out the window very long .
here i am at the airport waiting for my ride . what a beautiful place this is .
here i go in this big world all alone . i think i 'm gon na like this .
the nightlife here is so pretty and amazing looking . all around me is beauty .
we took off to our destination .
i got the window seat on the flight .
when we landed we immediately started exploring .
the city was huge and would take a while to get through .
we walked around all day and enjoyed some of the night as well .
the torkelson family went to the zoo .
mama , and the littlest girl had fun together .
the littlest kids went with uncle [male] to the aquarium .
then they rode the camel .
[female] and [female] , the twins , had fun jumping up and down .
we had a lot of fun at the park .
we brought some of our own entertainment .
it is hard being seen while hiding behind a big tree .
looks like some of the animals got loose .
this looks a little dangerous , she had better be careful .
we took the kids out for a fun day at the zoo !
our little one was overjoyed at all of the animals .
this little guy was intrigued but a little scared at the same time .
everyone loves a carousel though and these kids are no exception .
it 's always fun to take a break from the zoo animals and play a while .
they decided to take the kids to the day camp .
her daughter was a little nervous but she coaxed her to go play with the others .
her husband took their youngest boy to see one of the camp exhibits .
several of the children sat on a rhino sculpture and pretended to ride it .
at the end of the day two little girls jumped as high as they could to show how much fun they had at the camp .
the family was happy
that the child was smiling .
they took many photos
of the kids playing
and even on the rocks .
wow , we could not believe the price of this old book . [male] is trying to pick a gift out for me .
and my stalkers are back . i 'm not sure why they keep following me .
freezing my butt off ice skating . i only fell twice ! off to dinner .
organization organization organization be very jealous . best birthday dinner ever !
here i go , lets hope i do n't lose my dinner ,
the group all went out to lunch together .
then they took a walk through the cobblestone streets .
they checked out some of the amazing food .
everyone had a great time together .
they ended the evening with a group ice skating trip .
we did some window shopping while we were walking through town .
we were suddenly feeling like we were being followed , so we did the spy move of pretending to take a selfie to see who was behind us . maybe it was n't so sneaky after all .
we caught this photo by accident while we were rushing to try and make it to the restaurant on time for our reservations .
the food was absolutely to die for , and i am so glad that we got the chef 's tasting menu .
after our meal we went back outside only to find that the city had transformed into a wonderland of lights from all of the vibrant signs that were now turned on .
window shopping is fun , even when you ca n't afford it .
we could n't buy much so quickly left for a walk .
we love to ski at night . everything is light up and a green light shines over everythin .
we ate in a nice resteraunt . it was yummy .
the carnaval was amazing .
we did a lot during the holidays . first , we went window shopping .
then , we walked around town and took in the sights .
we went to a nice restaurant .
then we had a special dinner and dessert .
then we went on the organization wheel . we had a great time !
it was my first time traveling out to the harbor .
it is a busy harbor and boats were in and out all day .
the city and harbor have a long history as noted by various monuments and statures .
the harbor is for boating only ; we could n't swim there .
luckily , we ended the day at a nearby amusement park .
it was such a nice day by the beach we decided to walk around the town .
we went to the organization organization and got to see many people walking about .
the organization wheel ride was very fun and it was enjoyable to see the area from high above .
when we got to the boating area , we were not allowed to swim or dive .
towards the end of the day we were walking around and saw that the city was founded in 1820 .
a journey to the pier , historic sights and sounds galore .
we took time to sit off the edge and stare at the boats , imagining what life would be like if we owned one of them .
the statues were amazing to see , and the history was almost palpable .
before too long , it was evening , and we were turning to go in . we considered taking a dip , but that seemed like too much .
we did take a quick trip on the ferris wheel , though , before hopping into the car and running home .
[male] took a vacation at the beach .
he drove around to explore the area .
when he found a ferris wheel , he knew he had to ride it .
he wanted to go swimming in the bay , but it was not allowed .
he enjoyed his vacation and learning more about the city he was visiting .
when the men arrived to the marina they were greeted with this large anchor sculpture .
the marina itself was tourist free , and only shared the space with some brave seagulls .
the men decided to throw their crab pots in the water , right next to this sculpture , it seem liked a good place !
while waiting on crab pots , they chuckled at this sign , wondering who would actually be silly enough to swim here .
after crabbing for a few hours , they decided to end their day at the ferris wheel and boardwalk .
we went on a citytrip to location this weekend .
we saw many interesting buildings and were able to enter some of them .
this is the inside of the palace , everything is gorgeous .
this is the ceiling above us , it 's painted , it must have taken ages !
we finished our day with a few more outdoor shots before going on our way .
we took a vacation to location in the winter time .
we made sure to see all of the architecture .
some of these churches were just so beautiful , we were in awe .
the night time www perfect too . it was n't too cold for more sightseeing .
we finally took our last pictures in front of this great monument .
went to paris and first place i went , that 's right , the eiffel tower .
night life in location is exciting , i 'm headed for coffee .
at a church , these european churches are so exquisite .
the roof on this church took years to design .
here is the outside of the church . in the evening it looks spooky .
we started off at the eiffel tower .
then headed to th large buildings around it .
the state house was massive !
you would look up and just get dizzy .
we took pictures of the architecture and moved on .
on a trip to location we saw the location location .
we stopped by the location location location and it was incredible .
the l'hÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´tel national des invalides was also amazing .
it was so huge we took a ton of pictures .
the sacrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©-cÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“ur basilica was our last stop for the day because it was getting too late .
a trip into town is a lot of fun .
but you have to remember to get gas ,
the casino was empty .
the hardcore cafe was a lot of fun .
nighttime at the casinos is a good time .
for my birthday surprise , i was heading to location location !
our first stop was at the location location location for some history , good music , and tasty food ,
we was staying at the coolest casino on the strip .
there were many slot machines for each money denomination .
on my way out of the casino , i stopped to play one last machine and won lots of money !
today the group is off to visit a famous city that flourishes in the middle of the desert .
welcome to location location ! the city here is very hot and so is the entertainment .
the hotels and buildings are very flashy to attract tourism .
the biggest part of location location is the gambling
where fortunes are won and lost every day .
many cars move and wait in the city 's busy traffic .
gas signs beacon those that need it .
within the city , slot machines and other forms of gambling wait .
on the streets , lights and displays are dazzling .
some lights attract and dazzle people from quite a bit away .
we were on the road and ready to have a great time !
the gas was expensive , but we did not care !
it was time to hit the casino and have a blast !
this is such a beautiful guitar !
we then enjoyed the wonderful night scene !
the band was ready for the music festival .
[male] , the lead guitarist , was sure it would be their big break .
jory , the base player , just wanted to rock .
[male] , the drummer , was a little nervous .
the band was going to debut two new songs .
my buddy rob has a band in the making . they practice in his garage . he wanted me to take pictures .
this is rob at the helm of the drums . he 's actually pretty decent .
[male] is the guy with the pipes , and he 's the lead most times . adequate on the guitar . lead mostly .
rob was proud of his new amp , and wanted to show it off at this recent practice .
[male] is the rhythm guy . he does it just right .
my friend 's band came out on stage first .
the lead singer was very intense .
the lead guitarist really rocked it out .
the drummer was very energetic .
my friend and his band put on a great show .
we were playing a gig today .
suddenly the lights got really dim .
we asked them to fix it and they ended up getting way too bright .
we were all a little confused by this lighting situation .
eventually it got dark again , which was better than extreme brightness , so we dealt with it .
the band was having band practice today .
they were making sure all their equipment was working .
the guitarists were tuning their guitars .
the drummers were making sure the drums were working correctly .
they were finally ready to rock out .
[male] and his friend [female] of arc decided to go for a stroll . later , a church made stained glass images of this .
[male] and [female] wandered off in that story panel , although i could n't help admire the stained glass work elsewhere in the church .
i noticed what looked like [female] leading a little one with some kind of saint . curious .
then in another corner , a pretty gem of stained glass , matching the shape of a prior window .
i stared into the beauty , meditating on my existence , and the nature of god . worth it .
i went to the church last weekend .
there were a lot of people there .
the windows were very beautiful .
i had a great time taking pictures of them .
they had a lot of detail .
the stained glass in the old cathedrals was a great surprise on our vacation .
the masters of glass did a superb job here .
stained glass is a great art form and very colorful .
the subtle light that the glass lets in always provides comfort .
even though colorful , it is subtle and cozy .
[female] and [female] took a trip to their churches to compare the stained glass in each one .
[female] is really proud of this one showing flowers in her church .
[female] loves to show off this one .
they both compare this one to the one in marys church .
last they take a good long look at these large windows in sues church .
the quality of the stained glass art was amazing .
these flowers graced a small area .
this scene depicted an angel and a child .
here is another close-up of the flowers , which looks like a cross .
these panels look like a fine mosaic door .
my girlfriend and i set out on a trip to visit a very old building in our town .
after taking her picture next to the bridge she decided to take mine , much to my decline , but in the end i accepted .
as soon as we got to the front of the building i had to get a photo , the large arches visible even from a long distance away .
once inside the guide directed our attention to the inside of the arch , it 's detail giving away just how much work went into the building .
as if the inside was n't cool enough as we were walking out i noticed that the sidewalk too had it 's own unique design .
a group of friends took a road trip to a casino .
they played on the slot machines .
after winning money , they continued to play on other slot machines .
they went out for dinner afterwards .
they headed to the bar to finish out their night .
took a trip to location , right here is the location location .
see location behind me ?
this is a huge church we found while walking around .
look at how exquisite the building is .
the ground is very old and everything here looks so amazing .
a picture of myself along the river with location in the background .
a picture of my boy friend along the river with location in the background .
what a breathtaking building , i loved it .
look at the wonderful art work .
grass growing alongside the cracks .
you see how thrilled i was with our location visit .
my turn with camera as my husband poses with big [male] .
the architecture was very old and truly amazing .
i 've never seen anything like it at home .
everything is so green in location . even the weeds in the sidewalk .
it is almost time for christmas .
the decorations in the city were already set up .
they light up every night in different colors and flash on and off .
even the trees were scattered with light .
it was truly beautiful and it got everyone into the christmas spirit .
christmas is a very special time in our town .
every year they set up a special christmas display .
this year they went all out .
they decided to build the display inside a round train track .
i bought us all train tickets to see the display , it was a perfect viewing spot .
this was a huge christmas display i saw .
it was changing colors with a song that was playing .
there were lots of different colors and patterns being used .
here you can see that the tree is completely off during a slow part .
the song eventually ended and the lights were all static after that .
the kids wanted to go see the lights in the park for christmas .
the tree was multicolored this year .
the blue lights on some of the bare branches brought out the other colors .
the kids wanted to know why the christmas tree went out .
they noticed the second tree with the red at the bottom and decided they liked it the best .
regardless of what holiday it is , they always leave these lights here .
and it 's always fun to walk through here and just be in awe of how beautiful it is .
the christmas tree is 3 stories tall !
i go out on walks at night through here every other week .
i sometimes sit here on this bench and watch the lights flicker on and off . it 's really peaceful .
we went to a meeting today .
there where a lot of people there .
the speaker was very well organized .
we went to eat afterwards .
it was a very productive day .
what 's in the can ?
who cares when i can look out the roof .
i even did it twice .
this guy could n't be bothered to get too close to the computer .
so we stared at the wall instead of listening to him .
yesterday was a tough day at school .
we had to do group presentations .
ours went horribly .
we cheered ourselves up by going to the pub
and watching the game .
i started my day by having a dorm meeting .
then i had to go to class and take notes .
my professor was talking about economics today ,
my friends and i went to the bar after class .
we all watched the game together .
the students are listening to the lecture .
some students have laptop computers to take notes on .
the professor is showing his power point slides of the lecture .
after the lecture , several students decide to go to the cafe next door .
at the cafe , they watch the football game on tv .
i took my kids to the amusement park last week .
we had a great time there .
it was packed .
i had a great time . there were a ton of rides .
we bought some souvenirs there .
the girls and [male] riding in the the park .
a view of a small section of the park near the entrance .
a large roller coaster and ferris wheel at the park .
everyone has to get a turkey leg while at location location .
the rides lit up in the early part of the evening .
the family gathers together for a fun filled day and a selfie .
we joined the masses already there .
ca n't wait to start riding rides !
and ca n't forget the annual turkey leg contest .
all lit up . i love the colors !
the family was on vacation at location and took a selfie on the monorail .
it was a clear sunny day and they were relieved to see the park was n't too crowded .
they rode some rides , including a roller coaster .
they visited the gift shop and the dad insisted on buying a silly t shirt .
they went back outside after shopping and were in awe at how beautiful the park looked all lit up against the darkening sky .
the family took a trip to organization organization .
they arrived on such a beautiful day .
then they walked with the crowd to the park .
after that they came to the rides inside the park .
then they bought some souvenirs from the shops .
the ticket booth was just ahead ; we were going to get into the carnival !
we got a slice of pizza to fortify ourselves for the rides .
then , it was off to the ferris wheel !
we rode the roller coaster and managed to keep our insides , inside .
all the cars in the parking lot were gone , when we were ready to leave .
we went down to the beach to enjoy some sun .
afterwords we decided to hit the boardwalk to find some food .
we found a pizza place and all of us got a slice .
then in the distance we saw a rollercoaster !
so we got in line and rode it . it was the best day ever .
walking on the dock was very entertaining .
there we 're many other beach people there .
we had to get pizza for lunch .
on our way home , we scouted a new coaster .
the design is so interesting .
going to the fair this year was what i was looking forward to .
we stopped and got some pizza . i was so impressed with the pie that i had to take a pic of their sign .
we saw the ferris wheel from a distance from the fair . it made me get so hyped .
this is us going up the roller coaster . it was so much fun , but i got a bit sick from it .
the walk home . there was no one on the road when we decided to leave . i was sad but i know there will be a next year .
we spent a good hour walking on the boardwalk .
later that day we went into the city to find something to eat .
we decided on pizza .
afterward , we went straight to the amusement park .
in retrospect maybe immediately going for a roller coaster ride was n't smart .
the market was exotic to walk around and view .
there were flowers near the market with beautiful colors .
the sign indicated we had made it to the market .
later that night a [female] jam concert was awesome .
the organization the next day was just what was needed .
we went to seattle
and stayed in a hotel
we saw pearl jam
it was incredible
those guys jam
we arrived in the city and headed to the hotel .
we got our room and headed back out .
the city was beautiful at night .
we gathered with the masses for a show .
we watched it and continued our night .
we took a trip to the world famous pike place market .
we stocked up on a lot of fresh fruits , vegetables , and meats .
when we got hot and wanted to take a break , we stood under the shade and enjoyed some fresh drinks .
later that night we went to the [female] jam concert and enjoyed the live performance .
we stayed out all the way till morning and went to the nearest organization to get some pick me up drinks .
the tower was tall
but inside there was a tv .
they were near pj 's
and the pj sign was large .
they saw many lights .
today there was a field trip for all the little kids at the local school .
the kids wanted to ride all the big rides but it was a safety issue .
the kids wanted to play on the beach , it was so close .
after the beach they got to walk down the board walk and see all the great rides , shops and people .
father down the board walk they could n't help but wanting the coaster , it was awesome .
the children were on a field trip .
[female] was having a lot of fun .
she wanted to ride the organization wheel .
the boardwalk looked like so much fun .
their teacher said they would all go there later .
today the school visited the pier .
the pier was like a fair .
however , it was on the beach !
there were a bunch of rides and shops to visit and have fun .
the crowd favorite was of course the rides . the kids had a great time .
youth trips are an important part of the education process .
however , who said that learning had to be only what comes out of books .
the learning process can take many forms . including forms that are fun and educational at the same time
getting outside the walls of a school often fosters creativity once hidden by routine .
at the end of the day each learning experience could always include a fun time at a boardwalk carnival .
field trip day with a lot kids going to the beach , with a carnival to visit also .
the ferris wheel that we are in line to ride on .
after riding some rids , we head to the beach to swim and make sandcastles .
a look at some of our group on the dock .
another fun ride that some of the kids are waiting for .
i walk to work at the huge sattelite dish most days .
it stands out in the fiend , a giant listening and speaking tool .
it 's a beautiful walk in , with bunnies all about .
i work as a guard and handyman for the dish .
in my spare time , which i get a lot of at this job , i carve bald eagles .
we went to the space audio center
they use billion dollar equipment to listen to space
sometimes they hear stuff
and then they investigate
the wooden falcon out front signifies division
it was a nice walk we had today ,
we went by a giant satellite dish ,
and saw some wild bunnies .
it just rotated all day ,
many parts of the park had sculptures .
he was all about getting to the great outdoors .
he enjoyed the smell of fresh cut grass .
wildlife .
it 's too bad technology was there too
he longed for a reversal so to speak , he had n't seen an organization organization organization , ever , at least not a real one and he knew it was due to all the pollution , all the advances in technology had certainly taken a toll .
it was time to see some great sites outdoors !
this satellite was beautiful up close !
it was so huge and glorious to watch !
this was a gigantic satellite !
what a beautiful and amazing way to end our trip !
i won tickets to go to location location !
after spending a few hours wondering the strip i decided it was time to go gamble .
walking past a random casino i felt it in my gut to try my luck in there .
i spent a few hours spinning the slots and tried my hand at roulette .
by the time i left the casino i was up $ 400 , needless to say this was the best trip ever .
i went to the casino last week .
there were a lot of resorts nearby .
i spent most of my time gambling .
i also walked around to the other casinos .
they were all very similar .
location location is a very exciting city .
it 's in the middle of the desert , but the culture is far from dry .
the city is known for its big casinos
where fortunes are won and lost every day .
i guess that 's why they say `` what happens in location , stays in vegas . ''
a man took a trip to location location .
when he got there , he became enthralled by all the bright lights .
he immediately decided to try his luck at a casino .
he tried the slot machines first , but was n't having much luck .
he decided to call it a night and go watch a show instead .
the couple arrived in location .
they went to their hotel to check in .
then they drove around the city .
there were so many lights and exciting things .
the town was live in action .
it was [male] and [female] 's two year anniversary and they were excited to celebrate it .
they loved each other a lot and paused to capture the moment .
they started seeing some strange people .
they realized that they were somewhere they had n't really meant to be .
so they left to go somewhere a little more romantic .
the festival was underway .
there were colors all around .
the flea circus was in town .
the characters were interacting with the crowd .
it made for a fun afternoon .
at the flea circus today , this is one great time .
here we are , ready to have fun and blend with the culture .
these two are priceless beauties .
everyone wants peace here , no rioting , no fighting just a good time with peace and love .
this was a band going around the whole event .
ahh , the sights and sounds of it .
they had to get a selfie .
do n't forget to snap a pic of the mermaids .
and the young hippies .
his father had been a hippie .
we went to our towns annual circus today .
it was such a grand event , people look for to this day every year .
they have so much to do there and so many things to see .
very weird people there that do side shows . it 's so cool !
there were all kinds of things to see !
our town hosted a carnival and the officials change the drinking in public rules .
local musicians would happily play your favorite songs for a donations .
the organization organization makes me feel dizzy just watching it go .
we even had battle of the bands competition .
the street boasted many different vendors will from normal foods to exotic .
what ? no alcohol in public . guess i better down my beer .
wow , what i could do with that tall girl . wonder if she 'd be mad if i messed up her makeup .
the concert is starting . ca n't even drink during it though .
looks like some drunk idiot got hurt and they had to call the fire dept ... haha .
oh yes , i have the munchies ... how did you know .
we spent the day on the pier enjoying the festivities .
the street musicians are always great entertainment .
the ferris wheel looming against the cloudy sky gave us pause though .
a local band performed for the crowd . they were great .
who does n't enjoy carnival food ? it 's nearly always fun and flavorful !
we knew the rules of the park .
our first stop was to watch a street performer .
then off to ride the ferris wheel .
the concert was amazing .
we topped the day off with a treat .
[female] and i went to a local culture festival .
there were tons of interesting street performers .
there were also a few carnival rides to go on .
they even had some great bands playing .
to top it all off we got ice cream
my girlfriend [female] is the most beautiful girl on earth .
i take pictures of her all day long .
we walk around the city , looking for lovely spots to highlight her beauty .
but even industrial boring spots look wonderful with her near them .
i feel sorry for every other man in the world for not having [female] for their own .
yoshiko wants to be a model
she went to location to do some test shots
she is a natural
her photographer is pleasantly pleased
she is going to be successful
beauty is often a timeless endeavor .
it 's important to have a photogenic model as well as the proper camera and equipment to make sure each photo is raised to its potential
a photographer has to experiment with many different poses and angles .
once the shot is right they capture that moment and it becomes timeless .
at the end , nobody will know what you went through to get that perfect picture . they will just see the photo and know how great it was .
the girl was getting her senior pictures done .
she was very excited to be graduating .
she took some pictures outside .
she found a pretty spot to pose on .
then they moved inside .
i decided to do a photo shoot to get some more pictures for my portfolio .
i showed the model a picture i had just taken to give her some feedback .
here , i am practicing with forced perspective between the sidewalk , trees and model .
in this picture , i like how i played with the varying angles and lines of the stairs and the models legs .
this is just a nice shot using the background in a smart way while still focusing on the model .
we went sight seeing this week on vacation .
there were many interesting buildings to be seen .
we liked the colors and size of this casino . we did n't go inside since we are n't gamblers .
this sign caught our eye , it was interesting ang big !
this is an ancient chinese gate we saw on the way back to the hotel .
when we went to the city , we saw a lot of great architecture .
this building was so beautiful !
this building was newer , but built in an old style .
the carving on this building was so detailed !
i loved seeing this building all lit up at night .
we found great photo ops on our outing . the city across the water is a great view .
this old building lit up with modern day lights almost seems a conflict of itself .
a lot of people come to admire the cityscape .
the old architecture is certainly something we appreciated on our outing .
the lights at night always give the city a different feel .
they were almost there .
they had come by ship .
what an interesting city .
the city of chan .
it was a dream destination .
i traveled to the city and looked at the water .
there was a historic building .
everyone stood outside and observed it .
there were many buildings to see .
we stayed at a beautiful motel when it stated to get dark .
they could n't help themselves , they had to ride the bumper cars ...
however , she was a terrible driver !
she then forced him on the tea cups ...
where he seemed to get a little queasy .
but , neither would ride the ferris wheel .
i love bumper cars .
the kids had fun .
they crashed a lot .
then this ride .
it was like the teacups .
the bumper cars are always my favorite thing to do when i 'm at a carnival .
having a partner in crime makes it that much more fun .
this ride can really make you dizzy if you know how to spin it .
the wind is blowing overtime on this ride .
the ferris wheel is a good ride to go on in the evening .
the kids were in bumper cars
and were having a ton of fun .
they looked around
and liked what they were seeing .
the ferris wheel was huge .
when i was a kid there was nothing i loved more than bumper cars .
it was one of the only times that i did n't fight with my sister .
my sister is pretty dominant and never let me have the steering wheel , but it was still fun .
we would always end our day at the carnival by riding the teacups .
my sister finally yielded to me and let me pick the blue teacup .
most americans have never been to location . they are missing a very lot .
there is no place on earth with more ancient treasures , like these statues .
the beauty of so many buildings is astonishing .
the geometric patterns are wonderful .
and of course , there are oriental rugs . this one is guarded by metal robots !
the art of location is amazing .
these are statues of past rulers , they are incredibly detailed .
this is a replica of one of their ships from long ago .
this building showcases some of their architectural prowess .
the tapestry hung on this wall must have taken a very long time to weave .
the location museum
had a nice array of objects .
the ceiling had great designs ,
and in multiple rooms ,
it displayed their culture .
we visited a persian museum on our trip .
i learned so much about the history of that culture .
the museum itself was very impressive .
location has a unique style all its own and the patterns are beautiful .
such a long history and rich culture .
the man was visiting an art museum .
there were a lot of interesting statues .
there was also miniatures .
the mini building was so detailed .
the art museum trip was a success .
people were on there way to have fun .
there was a fair going on and they wanted to attend .
in the fair there happened to be a religious guy spouting his views .
there was a lovely ferris wheel people could ride on in the fair .
the fair was in a beautiful city as night descended .
everyone took a trip to location location .
and then stopped to get some food .
and checked out a local street fair .
the city was gorgeous at night .
they ended the evening with a beautiful carousel ride .
[male] took a trip to the city .
he went to a festival where many people were eating the tasty food .
he also saw a man preaching to the crowd .
there were rides , such as a farris wheel .
as the day came to an end , the skyline of tall buildings looked beautiful against the sky .
today i ventured downtown .
it 's not often i see huge buildings
and protesters on the same block .
i also forgot we had an amusement park .
i stayed until early evening .
the streets are busy with people walking to the local fair .
this woman is trying the food at the fair .
there are many people walking around , there are even people protesting at the fair .
one of the favorite rides there is the ferris wheel .
the fair is over at night , but the lights of the city buildings are still on .
yesterday i went sightseeing with my family .
my brother was being silly jumping in the air .
my sister decided to join him . they both were having a good time .
my cousin decided to pose like a statue .
we had fun visiting the boat dock and watching all the amazing fish the fisherman caught .
the oldest brother came up with a fun idea for family pictures .
the sister agreed it was a great idea and her photograph in the field showed a lot of personality .
the younger brother was being silly as always .
after the pictures were done they headed into the city .
the siblings met up with a few friends they had n't seen in years .
we took a short trip out to the fields to take pictures of some flowers .
we had more fun than we thought we would .
everybody was having a great time taking so many pictures .
from there we thought we would continue with our adventures and go to the pier .
we went to the pier and took many pictures of the boats there as well .
recently our family took a trip to location to see some family members . location is so beautiful !
much of the landscape is different than people imagine .
aside from some of the crowded cities , there is beautiful countryside as well .
but , my favorite part of the trip was any time we got to spend near the water .
i wonder if these cool boats can be shipped back to the location location ? i wish ; i 'd love to have one .
[male] was trying to take the best photo for his senior year photos .
he took a lot of interesting ones to be put in the yearbook .
he was very creative with his photos and eventually sent them in .
he was so happy they were all accepted and he even won a picture contest !
the prize was this amazing boat , which [male] uses to fish
the family is sitting down on the grass at the park to watch the fireworks display .
the fireworks are supposed to be choreographed to music this year .
the father tells his daughter that in his country fireworks are called fire flowers .
the colors and displays definitely justify the name .
the family watches the display and our happy at the colorful lights .
fireworks are pretty .
there were white ones .
and there were multi color ones .
and then there were some blue ones .
and then some pink ones too !
the fourth of july fireworks are very famous in the city .
they start out with synchronized explosions .
they continue to get bigger and better as the night goes on .
towards the end of the show , the fireworks become even more spectacular .
the fireworks finale lights up the night sky .
as the fireworks went into the sky , the family waited for the finale to start .
as the fireworks started to explode , the people watched in awe .
the crowd started to cheer as most of the fireworks exploded .
with three large booms , the crowd began to applaud .
with the final boom , the sky was lit red .
did you see the lightening behind the fireworks
i have always loved firework displays
the big ones make beautiful designs in the sky
how much time do you think it takes to put this together
the entire sky is full
we went to a convention for sports attire .
there where a lot of different displays .
and a lot of different uniforms .
lots of sports equipment as well .
everyone there where helpful and informative .
there were a ton of people at the baseball convention yesterday .
there were many different kinds of merchandise available for sale .
i spent a long time looking at all of the various tables .
i enjoyed chatting with the people at those tables .
afterward everybody got together for photos .
i 'm glad to be at the global hitman convention .
this is the sweet hitman clothing line . see the quality of material used .
this is the full shebang . everything a hitman needs to look sharp .
okay , lady ! i was hooked by the brand name . and the slogan `` hit hard for less , '' was genius . i 'm sold . give me one of everything .
me and some of my fellow co-workers meeting up after a long time apart .
prior to the conference starting , there was a brief mingling period .
the jackets and jersey 's were all ready for the newly acquired players .
in addition , there was a showcase of shoes , and various items , so that interested individuals could purchase .
the seller was networking with a potential client .
the owner 's of the team pose on their big day .
the press conference was soon and i was not yet dressed .
i went to a local store to find appropriate clothing .
i also had to find shoes and socks .
after i was appropriately dressed i helped set up the panels .
we got to meat the heads of the company and i even became a partner !
when we were on vacation , we found lots of things to do .
we went to an amusement park , and we rode on the plane ride .
later , we rode on the roller coaster .
we also found a pirate adventure place .
we went to see the wax sculptures , too .
the crowd was kicking that night
it was a great day to be alive
the light lit up the night sky
there was so much to see at the park
the people loved the roller coaster
i like to ride coasters that go upside down .
the rides here are really fun .
some are mellow .
this fun house was a bit scary .
i will definitely come back .
he was n't infatuated with amusement parks like she was .
for him it was obligatory .
strictly to please her .
he found them rather juvenile .
why could n't she like the things he did ?
it was time for a fun time at the carnival !
the rides at the carnival were scary , but fun !
this ride took our breaths away !
there was so much beauty in this place !
we all had so much fun by the end of the day !
since our little girl was sick mommy took extra protection to make sure she did n't catch anything .
shortly after getting the clear from the doctors she removed her mask to pose for this picture .
after meeting with the doctor and posing for the picture we meant with my wife 's sister who was the head of the hospital nursery .
after meeting up my wife 's sister took our daughter to do a picture for the hospital .
when the day was over with my wife attempted to mimic this funny statue that she found in the nursery .
does it really take 9 months to make a baby , mom ?
ca n't we just steal this one ?
[male] does n't look so sure he 'd like to be stolen .
sister makes a distraction while mom wheels the baby stroller out the door .
safe at her hideout , mom can remove her mask and cuddle her stolen baby .
took [male] to the childrens museum today .
we posed for our first picture in front of the giant rose .
and mingled with the others .
we watched some work in action .
and then cut up with some of the cartoon figures .
the two young women are looking forward to start the day .
the young child is curious to explore her world .
they walk around inside to check out the scene .
the teacher demonstrates to the girl how to be creative .
a silly pose is taken next to a funny statue .
the family took a trip through location .
they visited a children 's museum in the city .
then took a lot of pictures to remember their day .
the kids got to make art work .
then they found a cartoon statue .
a day at the beach .
spending some time at the boardwalk .
funnel cakes are good .
then a ride on the rides .
the tilt-a-whirl will be a good time .
the moment i arrived at the beach i had to step in the sand .
when i looked o the right i noticed there was no one close by to take my picture .
i dipped my toe in the ocean and it was o cold to the touch .
after the beach i walked up upon a ride and i was so scared of the look of it .
after the great day i had i just ha to stop to get some awesome funnel cake .
we spent the day on the pier . the view of the ocean was fantastic .
we visited a lot of colorful vendors on our day out .
who does n't love a funnel cake when visiting a festival ?
the rides are always great fun on the pier .
we rode the tilt a whirl which reminds us of our childhood .
a family decided to go to the beach .
they stopped at some shops nearby .
they saw a sign for funnel cakes and decided that is just what they needed to start the day off right .
after they ate , they went on some rides .
once they got on the tilt-a-whirl , they wished they had n't eaten all those funnel cakes .
we visited the beach ,
however since it was a cold rainy day ,
we stopped in for some funnel cakes .
we also jumped on rides .
ca n't forget how hard it was to keep our food down .
i am extremely pleased that i came here for vacation .
every part of this town in location is beautiful . especially the hotel i 'm staying in .
the bar has a elaborate lighting set up on the ceiling .
even though my hotel is beautiful , i decided to explore the area at night . absolutely breathtaking .
on my route , i found another classy bar i can sit down and have a good drink in .
every year we took this bridge to go to a wonderland of christmas lights .
the grass was lit on each sides of the road leading into town .
buildings were decorated in thousands of sparkly lights .
they even had the lights to create stars .
when we got to the end of the street , we had to pull over because daddy had a headache .
my husband trying to get a good view of what is going on .
a view of the outside of the hotel that we stayed at .
beautiful lights that they have hung up outside .
we took a nice long quite walk at night .
we got hungry , so we ended up at a restaurant .
i was drinking some liquor the other night feeling pretty tipsy , so i decided to amble back to my apartment .
the building was decorated in christmas lights , so it was like a beacon to guide me in .
all of the sudden , i started feeling dizzy . the lights started spinning over my head !
i came to in front of another building , not sure how i got there !
i decided to duck into the closest bar , ordered a water , and waited till i felt more sober .
we all decided to go out on the town for the night
the city was well lit up and beautiful .
the lights were absolutely stunning .
everywhere we went looked amazing .
and the bar we chose was nice and laid back . great experience .
the wheel ride was fun .
there was lots of food at the faire .
i could eat this whole pig .
then back to the wheel ride .
the day ended with a look at this building .
the store front was in view .
we stopped for nuts .
they had a great variety .
then we rode the ferris wheel .
our last stop was the mock castle for photos .
i went to the local fair today .
they had an amazing selection of concessions .
they were even roasting a whole pig for dinner .
the ferris wheel was huge , but i 'm scared of heights so i did n't get on .
everyone was gathered for the pig feast when dinner time came around .
it was time for a great adventure at the carnival !
there was so much to do , see and eat at this place !
this is one of the awesome scenes you ca n't find anywhere else !
the ferris wheel was a classic form of fun !
we had an absolute blast at the carnival !
the ferris wheel was large
and near a shop .
the shop had a pig
and the ferris wheel was tall
near the castle .
we started our trip at this unique structure .
then we traveled to this outdoor casino .
my husband stumbled upon this telephone booth .
then he decided to smile for a personal picture .
we found this figurine in the museum too .
i saw the time on the clock tower . the quaker boys were waiting for me .
traffic was stuck in place so driving wasnt an option .
so i thought maybe i will call a cab . but the phone booth didnt work .
defeated i see a line of buses passing . i wave one down and hop on en route to the organization house .
finally made it with five minutes to spare ! the boys will share laughs with me about this ordeal .
location is the most beautiful place .
one summer we went their for a visit . i remember the night lights shining over the water .
can you believe that they actually still have telephone booths ?
my lovely husband was a real sport and followed me everywhere i wanted to go .
before we left , we drove by the tall pointy building with clock one last time .
we went on vacation . i took so many pictures that i dont even know where this was taken .
the nights where so bustling . here are some cars parked just waiting on valet .
it was odd seeing these , and even odder to see them in use .
more of the night life . i guess i just come from such a small town that the sight of so many people threw me off .
this place was awesome to visit . i remember we had such a good time here .
we finally decided to visit location .
we immediately noticed how much more traffic there was here than in our small town .
during our ride we saw a telephone booth for the first time !
eventually our taxi dropped us off to our hostel we were staying at
called the `` quaker meeting house '' .
at the patio , we found these colorful umbrellas .
two blocks away , we explored this yellow home .
the man directed us towards this scene in town square .
town square was nice but the fair was more fun to us .
the fair was near a boardwalk and we went there later .
bright and colorful umbrellas are lifted to show off this occasion .
the lit up front of a very historical building .
down the river we can get a glimpse of the taller structures of the city .
i drank out of this water fountain .
the lights from the city glowing their brightness across the water way .
colorful umbrellas were displayed inside the room .
the outside of the building was painted in bright yellow .
nearby the calm dark waters rippled near the surrounding buildings .
but the ferris wheel made its presence felt as the sun set .
and the empty sidewalk signaled the end of another day for pedestrians .
colorful umbrella in the museum
our first stop was the museum the kids love it and educational
wonderful photo i took over the river
our first ride on the sky wheel , saw the city on the top
lighted pathway going to the hotel what a wonderful entrance they have
the city had several attractions such as a museum and
the largest university in the state .
many tourists came to see the lake located in the central part of the city .
sculptures were also scattered throughout the city .
many tourists would comment on how beautiful the city looked at night .
it was a windy day outside , so tons of people gathered to fly kites .
children and their families were having a blast together flying kites .
the wind made it perfect kite flying weather .
many people gathered to see the different types of kites .
there were also pinwheels for sale for those who were not flying kites .
we bought a variety of wind toys to play with in the park .
my daughter bought a red and black kite .
my son bought a multi-colored kite .
i bought a remote-control helicopter .
i also bought a wind fan to take home and stick in the yard .
the sky was perfect for kite flying .
even very young kids were managing to get a lot of air beneath theirs .
i could n't believe how high some went .
some were really creative with what they had brought .
of course , i could n't leave without buying a windmill .
the first thing we saw a the festival was this cool circular creation .
sister got her kite up really high in the air .
brother is getting ready to get his kite flying !
we got to see a helicopter up close !
at the end of the day dad was carrying all of our stuff out of the festival .
being able to fly is a very fun thing .
kids might enjoy experiencing flight
by flying kites . some are colorful and add life to the sky .
if you are lucky , you might even get to ride in a helicopter .
however you experience flight , let it be fun and memorable .
the whole art class loved the field trip idea .
we walked around the near empty area , amazed by its beauty .
it was the beginning of fall and getting colder but the sight was still apt for photo taking .
even the empty theme parks got our attention .
we decided to cover more ground by taking an ancient way around town .
sometimes , desolation and emptiness lead to a lot of beauty .
this rural road , covered with snow and bereft of people , is a work of art .
the details of this merry-go-round , combined with the feeling of fallen elegance , create a powerful picture .
the statue of many escaping people always brings me to tears .
when there 's a splash of light in the gloom , it can be almost hard to look at .
the park weather was nice ,
we walked around ,
and enjoyed our surroundings .
the rides were for younger children ,
so we took a ride in the cart .
she decided to go and try out her new camera and filters .
the one she used most made the edges dark and cast a greenish-yellow tint to everything .
this carrosel looks pretty creepy with the filter on the picture .
this sculpture looks like something crawling out of a horror movie .
the last pictures she took was of these two bicycles and even they have an errie look about them .
the park was vast
and had many trees .
it was near a stadium
that had an abandoned ride
but people still came .
i ate dinner quickly .
i wanted to go to the bank .
on my way home i saw the ferris wheel .
the streets were awash with color .
the skyscrapers reminded me why i had moved here .
the night started at the a ! .
the ferris wheel is seen from a distance with purple and blue colors .
a view from a street corner on a cold fall night .
the cities skyscrapers were light up and beautiful .
the ferris wheel had change colors throughout the course of the night .
here are some souvenirs that we got on our tip .
this is a sign that we saw and thought it was interesting .
a look at the carnival at night with all the lights showing up .
we are out taking a stroll in the evening .
a view from across the river , what we saw .
we got off at the airport and went to look around .
we toured the city for a bit .
as evening grew , the streets became more quiet .
the buildings around us where huge .
we walked around a bit more before heading to the hotel .
it was a beautiful scene in this wonderful city !
there were so many things you do not see everyday !
this carnival was so amazing and beautiful !
there was so much to enjoy and view !
the nightlife was just amazing to look at !
i have wanted to be an astronaut since i was a little girl .
so i visited the headquarters of organization .
i got to meet a real astronaut live in the flesh !
he showed me the biggest rockets they had on sight .
we spent the rest of the day speaking about jet propulsion and other cosmic related matters . as inspired as ever i hope to be coming here every day for work soon .
yesterday was out field trip to the space station .
there , we got to see a real rocket .
the floors even had there logo on them .
the receivers we saw were huge .
at the end we got to meet an astronaut .
my female friend loves to take personal photos .
we traveled to a neat space building .
there we met this man who was a pleasant janitor .
he showed us around the facility .
he even showed us some of the newer technology .
this woman got the chance to tour organization .
when first walking in she saw the organization logo painted on the floor . her heart was filled with excitement .
even her dad was happy to be there .
later in the tour they went outside to see the spaceships parked there .
the booster rocket looking things were really cool . the tour encouraged the girl to follow her dreams to become an astronaut .
my brother has always wanted to work for organization .
he was excited when we took a trip to one of their facilities .
i took a picture of myself when we got there .
i also photographed some rockets .
this is how their engines look up close .
color evokes so many feelings . from the simplicity of a red chair ...
to the warmth of a yellow flower .
the detail of a green topiary ...
to the cold blue in this photo .
color enhances my soul . live the rainbow !
my friend and i visited an art gallery .
i am a big fan of abstract art and it truly inspires me .
my favorite piece of artwork was a sculpture that looked like socks .
my friend 's favorite was a wavy colorful sculpture .
visiting the art gallery has inspired me to create some artwork of my own .
fire engine red chair , so pretty .
i love yellow tulips , they give life to any room .
these decorative plants all together make the room give the room even more life and energy .
i love the pigment of the blue here .
this color wheel is fun .
the kids flipped through the patterns book .
they had to find a pretty picture to make into their collage .
they found lots of colors and patterns .
but not one that they loved enough .
until they came upon this plain picture , they loved red !
today we had a color scavenger hunt at my school . i found a red chair for red .
outside i found yellow flowers and crossed off another color .
green trees meant another one down .
here is where i was able to cross off blue .
i tried to use this rainbow art decoration for my remaining colors but it did n't count and i lost ...
a group of friends went to the carnival and bought snacks .
they rode on the rides .
they rode on the ferris wheel .
they played carnival games to win prizes .
they played one last game together before they went home .
[male] was having a great time at the fair .
he even went on the ferris wheel .
this is favorite ride he is now at the top and he takes in the scenery .
after getting off the ride he heads over to grab some lunch .
after lunch he goes to get some ice cream .
we enjoyed a lot of great snacks during our visit to the carnival .
the carnival rides are scary , but we had fun !
this ferris wheel was a fun ride and reminded us of our childhood .
the vendors were lined up ready to feed us or sell us their wares .
this simple sign was effective in rousing our curiosity .
the man wore a blue shirt and spoke softly .
the ride was fun bit a bit dangerous .
we rode the wheel for a bit to experience joy .
the train was scary at night .
we decided to go to a small diner for dinner .
he was a pig .
hopefully he would n't get sick .
damn , he did .
he better stick to the fairway .
oh wait , more food .
the parade had many small cars .
these guys are driving small tractors .
this couple is in an old-time car .
there was also a car show .
there were some great rides to ride .
the antique car show and race was the other day .
there were antique tractors .
some people brought old buses .
a few people brought vehicles that looked like old trolleys .
however , most of the vehicles there were antique cars .
the race was really entertaining , and
creative to see the drivers ride their creations .
these two made a very good pair ,
and we got to sit and touch vintage vehicles .
then we went to the vintage shop and got some collectibles .
these people are getting ready to enter their antique vehicles in the big race .
these two men are part of the special race between one person mini trains .
contestants and spectators have come from all over .
one of the requirements for this race is that vehicles be steam powered .
even the cars of persons who entered the race are vintage .
i went to an old car show .
my kids loved these cute little train looking mechanisms .
a bunch of old busses all lined up .
i wondered if people really actually drove these .
this car would be fun to drive even in the modern era .
a welcome sign that greets you as you enter the county fair .
prizes ranging in many shapes and sounds .
i watched other people on this ride and refused to ride this ride .
jugglers performed in the center of the fair and sometimes with fire !
at night the lights turned on and created an amazing view .
the carnival came to town today .
my boyfriend and i came to play fun games and win prizes .
we even ate terribly unhealthy foods like beer batter cheese on a stick . delicious .
my boyfriend won me many prices , including a stuffed shark .
we stay at the carnival well into the night , just having fun and being together .
i went to a local carnival . i 've never had beer battered cheese , i had to try it !
next i played a game to try and win the stuffed animal .
i went on a roller coaster ride 3 times !
after that i watched some jugglers .
lastly there was an evening music performance .
we had to stop and look at the huge `` cheese on a stick '' sign .
just look at all the little adorable stuffed animals !
the best part is when you turn upside down !
there were so many people gathered it was hard to find anyone .
this might have been the coolest thing i have ever seen !
the sign was offering cheese
and there were stuffed animals .
the ride was big
and the people juggled
before seeing lights in the night .
a photographer went to an abandoned amusement park to take photos .
the slide was rusted .
the rides had plants growing all over it .
the abandoned rides were rusted and fading .
the once happy looking house structure was now falling apart .
i had heard stories of the lost amusement park in the woods , but i did n't think it really existed until i came upon this slide .
it was something out of a neon dream .
the turtle ride nearby was creepy , with its wires still attached .
the old roller coaster looked ready to collapse at any point .
someone , this spinning ride hit me hardest . it looked like it had just been paused , and riders might reappear at any time .
this large slide went up really high ,
i got on and flew threw the hills .
this park has been abandoned ,
nothing electric works ,
and most of the rides have fallen down .
there was an abandoned amusement park nearby i decided to explore .
this slide looked like it would 've been fun .
this ride was completely overgrown .
there was a small roller coaster , but it was really rusty and covered in muck .
there was also this random little treehouse off to the side . i 'm really not sure what it 's purpose was .
there is nothing like a trip to the water park !
this water slide was huge and lots of fun !
it was amazing how many fun things this park had to do !
this ride made the trip extra fun !
the scariest ride of all was saved for last !
the which concert was a great scene .
everyone was looking forward to it .
some people went a bit cray .
everyone loved watching the show .
there was even a carousel to cap the night off .
our trip to the music fesival was great .
one of our favorite performers was just getting on the stage .
the weather was awesome and clear for us through the night .
in the distance , we saw the glow of an amusement park .
we had a wonderful time with friends and music !
we all went to the concert last night .
there were a lot of people there hanging out .
some people had too much to drink .
afterward we went the fair to relax .
the organization wheel is lit up at night by the beach .
we went to the music festival today .
our favorite band was performing .
all to soon the sun was setting .
afterwards we went to the carnival to have fun .
by the end of the night we were exhausted .
we had gone to a festival and heard some music
the music was great and got everybody excited for the fair .
they even dropped in some rides from the air for us to play on .
the ferris wheel was lit up as bright as the sun !
we all had a blast . except there was this shirtless guy who kept following us .
after arriving by boat we decided to check out the local amusement park .
we were n't quite sure where the amusement park was located so we just started walking anyway .
we passed by many different shops along the way .
finally we arrived at the amusement park but nobody was there .
it turned out that the park was closed today .
we are having a day walk on the beach . it was such a cloudy day .
hey look ! there 's an old ferris wheel .
this is our view for most of the day . it was beautiful ! the sound of the waves was heavenly .
i do n't think there 's a person in the world who does n't know who this is !
look at this old boat ! it slowly passed by us . it was adorable !
we were working the boats all evening , soon work was done .
we walked the pier with our income , ready to spend it .
here 's us ! most of the stores were , unfortunately , closed , so we decided to walk around .
unfortunate that location location was shuttered , i was really looking forward to it .
we stared at the attractions until it started thundering , and then we decided to drive home .
it was a gray and cold day on the location shore .
[male] decided to take a walk down the boardwalk .
he say other folks doing the same .
the stores were all closed for the season .
the merry-go-round was closed for the day too .
last fall i went for a walk down the pier .
there was a little girl playing on the sand .
the ocean looked very choppy , but there were still a lot of surfers .
a museum off the pier had a [male] [male] exhibit .
as i was leaving , i saw a ferry boat pulling up to shore .
the play house was an exciting place for the young and old .
dominant figures waited inside .
a royal set was included in the realistic interiors .
dress and other details matched that in real life .
indoor and outdoor sets made the experience life-like .
we were able to finally attend .
did n't know what to expect going into it all .
the costumes were the most beautiful .
the exhibit was so much fun .
we will be going back again .
this is a lovely entrance to the chinese play , `` to be communist , or not to be . ''
wonder what this little dragon has to do with the chinese government ? oh well , as long as it is n't breathing fire .
these people look like real statues . i wonder how they get their makeup so smooth ?
finally at the table . who 's the sumo ? i ca n't pick up his tab too .
i simply love the detail these people put into conducting their play scenery . i should ask the producer .
i was invited to a foreign show by one of my co-workers .
i had never been to anything like this before . there was so much colorful artwork everywhere .
when the show began i did not really understand what was going on .
but it was still fun to watch .
i took many pictures of that night and will always remember it .
we entered the fair 's pavilion through this fanciful gate .
the pavilion was decorated with curious objects like this dinosaur .
the main area of the pavilion was colorful and lively .
employees of the fair performed for the audience .
the dancers were especially fun to see .
the concert last night was so much fun !
there were tons of fireworks at the venue .
it was so pretty .
there were may people performing at the event .
some of them were my favorites !

is that a lightbulb ?
who cares , there 's a scantily clad girl now .
i wish i were closer .
like , as close as that guy !
a group of friends attended a large music festival .
there were fireworks there .
there was a large grand finale , too .
a well known rap artist performed .
and a famous female singer performed also . it was a great night .
the atmosphere was electric and exciting !
so many interesting surprises happened that night !

i love the city .
there 's so much to see .
like this place .
or these places .
some things were still being built .
in sightseeing for our vacation , we have come across some of the most beautiful architectural designs .
this design is actually stained glass , but in a more modern form .
the angles on the building give off the impression that one is moving fast .
however , from far away , it looks like a standard vintage building .
this coliseum is similar in design to the ones in rome , but just a bit more modern .
the best towns are towns with history everywhere .
history where art flourishes
and architecture shines bright .
the towns that were once bubbling with progress and ingenuity
are now relics of days gone by . it is a sight to see .
the entrance alone looked very big .
there was some beautiful designs inside .
the building looked very tall from the ground .
there were some other tall buildings too .
we even saw a round building .
the old church was beautiful .
the stained glass was like no other around .
it was easy to imagine the history of the church , and the people who use to attend it .
lots of tourists enjoyed walking about looking at the old buildings .
a few people liked the modern day buildings as well .
my trip to location was amazing .
i saw some colorful people .
i even made some knew friends .
i visited a beautiful pagoda .
then i saw a ordinary bicycle .
there is a little place in the city called little location .

the structures are beautiful and cultural .
everyone has their own way of celebrating the chinese lifestyle .
we attended this asian festival which was full of color and fun .
the costumed balloon handlers were a great addition to the gala .
our friends joined us in the morning for the fun .
the architecture of a pagoda is awe inspiring .
some folks are a festival unto themselves .
a day at the parade was very fun .
everything was in sync and on point .
school kids in the midst . having a good time at the festivities .
the historic temple and it 's a beauty .
awesome randomness .
my visit to location was fun and colorful .
i visited many temples .
i took a picture with some school girls . they thought it would be funny .
this temple was perched delicately above the water .
i am not sure what kind of hat she is wearing but it looks funky .
the whole family went for a `` family fun day , '' this weekend .
we went to the most popular theme park here and rode all the crazy rides !
my son was scared to ride this one because it was so high up , but my daughter was all for it !
we had to coax him to get on the roller coaster .
but when he did he confessed to having a great time !
we visited a theme park today . i wanted to ride this roller coaster i have heard about .
it took us very high in the air .
then it dropped us down so fast i almost lost my glasses !
we walked to another roller coaster , passing by some tower .
the next roller coaster was as much fun as the viper ! it was an exciting day for sure !
we spent the day riding roller coasters . we had beautiful weather for it !
they can get a bit scary at times , but we loved it .
everyone , and i mean everyone , screamed on this ride .
the old school wooden roller coasters are the best !
it 's hard to keep your hands in their air when you are terrified .
the new ride is called the viper .
it has a lot of sharp turns .
the first group that went screamed a lot .
i was watching from the tower in the center of the park .
the people loved it .
the viper was a big ride
that went very high
and fast .
people saw the tower
and rode the ride .
the fish pond was the main attraction .
the flowers were also pretty .
this bug was interesting .
this women made this kid go to the plant garden ,
time for fun on this ride .
there were a ton of plants in the garden .
there were so many different kinds .
some of them were exotic .
i had a great time there .
there were even some fish in the pond .
while outside walking alongside a trail , we saw fishing swimming in the creek .
the bees really love this beautiful flower .
there is a fly looking for food on the leaf .
i love the look on my son 's face with me .
to wine down , we ended up going on a few rides .
we stopped by a coy pond to relax one day .
the flowers around us where beautiful .
the bugs where out bad not that bad .
we laughed and hung out for a bit .
then we headed back into town .
the two colorful fish greet visitors to the garden .
the poppies are in full bloom at this time of the year .
the fly is enjoying a rest on a large leaf .
it is a great place for a mother to enjoy the day with her son .

the ferris wheel was lots of fun and had great views of the city .
we took a helicopter tour to see more .
this is the tallest building in the city - we ate at the restaurant on the top floor .
all our friends posed together for a photo .
mom and daughter were so excited for their first night out by themselves .
mom had planned all kinds of fun activities .
they went to the little girls museum and saw the characters .

she did n't want to leave his side the entire time .
we arrived at the hotel at night , ready to get some rest .
the next day it was time to explore the children 's museum .

a lot of people shared our love of this place and came to enjoy it as well .
the ponds were a beautiful sight to behold .
our stay here was full of natural beauty and wonderful manmade decor as well such as this lovely little bridge .
on our vacation we stopped by a large marina .
this marina was just packed full of boats , way too many for us to be able to go out .
instead we spent the day golfing on this beautiful course .
after the game we headed for this pavilion .
we ended our day with a nice cup of tea .
the marina would be a wonderful place to have the wedding reception .
the view of the boats and trees was great .
this was the spot to have the reception .
if it rained it could be moved under here .
after deciding where she enjoyed a cup of coffee with a smile on her face .
our boys have been swimming since they were little

surprisingly , they had some great sushi places there ! delicious .
we tried to ride every ride we could !
we could n't help but to ride this one more than once !
we recently took a trip to location for the first time .
my boyfriend is a flight enthusiast , so he was thrilled to see this place .
my husband refused to get on this ride with the kids , ca n't say i blame him .
just looking at this structure , i am convinced that i will stay on the ground .
this particular decoration reminded me of the organization states flag .
location 's location location is an american themed theme park .
there are tons of ways to have fun .
you can eat exotic foods that represent location 's melting pot of diversity ,
or you can ride the many rides that are all throughout the park .
whatever you do , i am sure that your time spent here will be memorable .
on my amusement park world tour . i stopped at location 's location location .

we were out walking one day .
we decided to take the tram .
when we got off the tram we noticed a fair nearby .
we let the kids ride on the merry-go-round .
afterward we went to the pier to watch the boats .
went to the pier today with my family . here we are enjoying a nice meal .
this kid is very curious .
here we are riding a streetcar . how fun is that ? too much fun .

the kids loved the merry-go-round .
outside of my office was this immaculate building .
inside the building was so delicate and intricate .
outside of the building was this statue .
this man 's face was also carved into the wall of the building .
on our way home , we snapped a picture of the bridge in the skyline .
around the bottom side of this monument , we see a large tower .
looking up from the bottom at the dome .
the location flag flies near the location location building .
criss crossing lines form this beautiful structure .
gargoyles stretch out from the old stone structure .
today , my family and i visited the twin towers memorial in location location location .
they really did a great job with every detail ( inside and out ) . including the elevator that shows you scenes of the old towers as you go up each level .
to think that the towers have been gone for almost 14 years is hard to believe .
the muesum is a sight to behold . i 'm glad we made the stop to check it out .
it was a tragic event nearly 14 years ago , but the muesum does a great job in remembering it
there are many different ways to look at something .
for me though it is all about trying to see things from a new angle .
sometimes you have to see what has been done .
to see the things that have not been thought of before .
there are moments that you have to pay your dues to the past .
exploring european buildings like this one is always fun .
you can see beautiful domed , blue architecture .
and large monuments to governments of the past .
even monuments to famous historical figures .
but a nice river cruise always makes the day end nicely .
we had a great time being down by the pier yesterday .
there we so many different rides down by the pier .
we went on many different rides .
they even had a castle set up !
and they had a full size pirate ship too ! it was a great day !
we left paradise pier and headed out in the open ocean ,
in the biggest ship to sail these waters in sometime .
the night was dark and scary and a storm was brewing .
lightening stuck our boat , we thought all was lost until we saw the castle in the distant .

our last and favorite ride was the ranger , boy was it fun .

what amazing art work with the dragon on the ceiling .
my son standing in front of the souvenir shop .
getting a good view one more time before we have to leave .
i went to a theme part .
there were lots of fun souvenirs .
i wanted to buy this kite but it was too expensive .
i posed with a lot of the characters .
this castle was scary but it had a fun ride inside .
we enjoyed the parade at organization when we were there .
the castle always makes me smile . i can remember seeing it the first time as a little girl .
[male] and captain hook were playing around and make the children and adults laugh .
the children enjoyed seeing all the characters they knew from movies and television .
[female] was telling [male] a secret . i wish i knew what she said before we left .
the magic kingdom castle is seen in the background during the parade .
the characters are having fun on the stage performing .

there was a program for children at the local ballpark .
some celebrities from their baseball program was on hand to help out .
the kids were able to go on the field and loved it .
some kids liked the stands better .
other kids had the opportunity to try throwing pitches .
i finally was able to take the boys to their first ball game .
here we were in our seats waiting for the game to begin .
he was leaning over to get a better look at his favorite player .
after the game , the crowd rushed onto the field .
the boys had a great time at the ball game .
the game was very exciting . it was so close and now it was finally over .
some of the commentators stayed to discuss the post-game .
after the team won a lot of fans ran out onto the field to celebrate .
some of the fans were very eager to jump out onto the field .
afterward we all said goodbye to the team and we went home .

afterwards people walked onto the field .
we got to walk across all the bases .
location location for a night game !
father and son are here to take in the game .
the stands are empty before the game begins .
a bunch of people appear on the field .
it 's a class of school kids given permission to run the bases !
the group started out the day together .
a boat ride to the island was a lot of fun .
once there the group split into several pairs because nobody could agree on what to do ; abut half of the people wanted to visit the amusement park .
others wanted to sit down and enjoy a quiet breakfast .
not everyone could agree on here to eat though , because some preferred to dine outside .
here i am on the first morning of vacation at the coffee house .
our group toured the shops and met back up later .
we met up for lunch and planned the afternoon activities .
some of us decided to take boats through the canal .
later in the afternoon , a few of us went to a local amusement park .
this morning i woke up and had coffee with a friend .
that afternoon i walked
to the bar to have a drink with a friend .
then we went boating .
we ended the day at the amusement park .
while downtown today we decided to follow a group of guys in orange .
they led us to a trip down the canal .
the boat took us to an amusement park that was closed for the season .
we settled down for coffee at a cafe .
and finally decided to sit outside for a while to end the afternoon .
coffee is always a great start to the day .
we all ready to start off our adventure
once last drink before we hit the road
hanging out on the water is so relaxing
amusement parks always make you feel like a kid again !
it was time again for the nighttime carnival , and the people gathered for a feast of the eyes .
the night was lit bright with excitement for the procession .
there were colorful characters of all sorts .
kids of all ages took part in the revelry .
it truly was a thrilling experience for all involved .
we went to this amazing festival downtown .
it was so much fun , everyone was having a good time ! even the kids !
there were these big puppets there , too . it was kind of frightening .
up close was even scarier ! but i still had a great time .
towards the end they were shooting off fireworks . it was a great end to an amazing festival !
i could hardly understand the machines , but being around the buzz of the crowd was intoxicating .
we saw thousands of creatures and myths played out on the streets .
one of the more frightening masks , with one of the better performers rounded out the performances .
soon , a band took the stage and started playing music .
after they started waving incense , i got ready to leave . my nose was a bit too sensitive .
the streets of location were filled up with parade floats last night .
there were adults and children celebrating on the streets .
a dragon walked through the parade .
and people wearing huge masks on their heads followed the dragon .
after the parade , the sky was filled with fireworks .
i went to a festival in location where i saw a parade .
there were a lot of vendors out . i bought some snacks .
i watched the whole parade , and took pictures of the various floats .
this float kind of scared me !
this was the last float of the parade . i was sad to see it end .
visited some strange places today . this was the sio-site .
an odd sculpture on the side of a building .
my favorite thing today ... a nice cold beer .
look at the size of these chicken tenders..they are huge .
after a day out , it was nice to come home to this awesome view .
[female] and shin [male] had a great time on vacation .
they went shopping at the mall .
they had a great dinner at a fancy restraunt .
shin [male] was tired and ready for bed .
the city was breathtaking at night .
they had been waiting for this day for awhile .
they kept their eye on the clock to be punctual .
frosty beverages were there for all .
the food was quite tempting .
the night had many things in store .
location was so different than location , it was a culture shock .
this strange clock was designed by a famous artist .
we worked up a thirst touring this city .
we also worked up an appetite , too , and i love japanese food .
this is the view from our flight home . we definitely plan to return .
i visited the location in location , location , a few years ago .
the location featured some very intriguing pieces of art , like this clock .
i grew bored pretty quickly though and visited a local pub .
the beer was good , but the fish was absolutely great .
i spent the rest of that evening in my 15th story hotel room drinking a beer and staring at the city .
a group of friends went to explore a nearby river .
they decided to go on a boat ride throughout the river .
they passed through the gate .
they passed by another tour boat during their ride .
they took a group photo after their ride on the river .
somehow , i got the feeling we were n't welcome in the abandoned factory area .
i ca n't stand a wired fence , so i went in anyway . the windmill blew around as if it were still needed .
i hit a second section of wall , topped with glass . that could n't stop me either .
this tall wall almost did , but i scaled it .
it was worth it when i walked the streets of factories and houses long ago emptied .
our day cruise up the river was a lot of fun and had fantastic views of nature .
the great bridges were in abundance so that crossing was possible .
the view of the water fading in the distance makes you appreciate nature .
the boat was small but comfortable . we felt safe on this one .
our friends enjoyed themselves on the river cruise too !
some places can be a bit more dangerous than others .
while they may not be dangerous due to disastrous conditions ,
sometimes they might just really want people to stay away .
high fences usually do the trick ,
but sometimes the building is scary enough to keep people out .
the place must 've had some rough security , barbed wire lined along the top of the fence .
there was a windmill that provided power .
and if you thought barbed wire was bad , the broken glass on top of the stone wall seemed even more frightening .
the fences stood very high , almost 20ft in the air .
i would n't be surprised if this used to be an old prison .
[male] celebrated his 45th birthday thursday .
all of his friends showed up to wish him happy birthday .
[male] 's cake was chocolate which is his favorite .
after he ate cake [male] 's friends played a prank on him .
[male] had a wonderful birthday party thanks to all of his friends .
the people were dancing in costumes at the party .
one man went a little overboard with the costume .

some of the party goers were posing for a picture .
the group is seen taking a picture with everyone smiling .

my husband turned 50 this past weekend and we had a party .
his sisters flew in from out of town .
and he loves chocolate cake so that 's what i made .
then he got a little silly after a few beers and tried to become a mummy .
i was very pleased that he spent this milestone birthday with his favorite people .
my friend , [male] , celebrated his 50th birthday last week .
i attended the party , along with my wife and her friends from work .
[male] blew out the candles on his birthday cake .
after that , we decided to cover him in toilet paper , which made no sense to me .
by the end of the night [male] was drunk , shirtless , and thought he was in location .
i had a great time at the bike park .
there were tons of bicycles there .
i really enjoyed it .
it was really cheap to get in .
i bought another bike while i was there .
an eco friendly city decided to try a new bicycle parking service .
people utilized this service in order to be able to park their bike safely .
interested customers discussed the concept with workers .
they had a new sign to attract customers .
many people were interested in trying out the valet service .
the sign is giving them some information
this is the area where they can park their bikes .
they examine the bike parking further .
a different angle on bike parking makes it more clear .
one last study of the display and they are now certain that they can in fact park their bike here .
the tent was set up in the city on a hot day .
they prepared the bicycle racks .
then they waited for customers to arrive .
they put a sign out by the street .
after that they were set up for business .
the poster was cool
near the bikes .
there were many of them
and the people were happy
to take their bikes .
it was a great day at the park
many people lined up for the ride
it was one of the best coasters in the country
and people loved the potato patch
the roller coaster was the hit of the night
every summer we take a roller coaster tour .
we ride the newest ones .
we ride the tallest ones .
we ride the fastest ones .
then we all go home and start planning for next year . it was awesome !
we are determined to ride a roller coaster today .
when we saw how big it was ,
we got butterflies in our stomachs .
we could hear the screams ,
but we got in line anyway .
good , a parking space .
now they had to stand in line .
it would be worth it though once they got on .
then they 'd check out a few game .
and maybe go back and ride it again later .
the view was very vast
near the rollercoaster .
the coaster was tall
and the potato patch had lots of food
for after the ride .
my wife took a picture in front of the shoreline .
after that , i took a picture of the shoreline .
then we took a picture together .
i snapped a magical image of the rocks going into the mist .
that night , we went to a concert at the venue .
darcie went to the beach today .
she went with her boyfriend [male] and she had a great time .
[male] was jealous because he liked darcie .
he thought about her all day and never stopped .
darcie did not like [male] and hid from him often .
spent the day at the beach , it was a lot colder than i thought it would be .
the waves were hitting the rocks pretty hard , hope i dont fall in .
me and my boyfriend always make time for some selfies together .
this walk was terrifying but i somehow came out alive !
ended the night at a concert . what a special day it was .
this was [female] 's and [male] 's first vacation to the beach .
the water was high from a recent rain storm .
the two posed together for a memorable picture .
the long rocky walkway was safe despite the high water .
the capped off their day by watching a concert by the ocean .
[female] needed a cool profile picture for her organization account .
rich thought it would be nicer if he was involved .
a giant soda was what rich had been craving all day .
he thought about what other types junk he should consume that day .
the date ended when [female] was even too embarrassed to get a picture .
it was a chilly day at the beach , everyone had to bundle up .
the commercial we were shooting was going to take a lot of work .
there wasnt a lot of people so we had to work together to get this done .
luckily the director was a chill guy and had things under control .
afterwards cleanup was a mess but it was totally worth it .
the foundation of the set was so intricate .
outside , the cast talked in blankets .
the camera crew put in a lot of hours this weekend .
the director was very committed to the project .
one of the camera men went to new heights to get the footage .
we were doing some set up for the concert following us , getting paid good money to do it too .
here i am , with the squad .
getting the cameras set up was one of the easier parts , adjusting for glare and wind was exceptionally difficult , though .
here i am , taking a bit of a lie down .
and here 's me again , taking a sit up ! we were done not long after this was taken .
our movie was off to a rough start this morning , waiting for the lighting to be set up .
everyone was working hard , trying to perfect it .
the actors patiently sat and waited .
finally , it was time for our first take !
the crew worked very hard to get the scene just right !
the filming had n't begun yet but [male] was feeling uneasy .
the cameramen were all ready and motioned for [male] to get on set .
there were many people working on the set that day .

everything looked so much bigger up close !
the entrance was decorated with patriotic flags . it made me proud .
the statue of [female] was a sight to behold ! i waved goodbye and it seemed like she was waving back .
i snapped a shot of a historical block in town .
nearby , i saw a beautiful flag .
my husband wanted to see the statue so we traveled there next .
the town hall was well furnished .
the furniture was still very vintage though .
we took a ferry to the statue of [female] .
they searched my backpack at one point .
we also saw buildings on location location .
the buildings were expansive inside .
the statue of [female] is very large and beautiful to see .
we were so excited to visit the statue of [female] that we almost missed the sign .
the location flag flew outside on a perfect day .
we were awestruck by the immense size of the statue .
in the lobby , more flags hung .
we found the gift shop and bought many beautiful wicker baskets .
we finally arrived at our vacation destination .
how lucky . we found a place right on the beach .
this is a cute guy i met on the first day . we really hit it off right away .
we were going to take a swim , but the water was way too cold .
loved the ferris wheel the best . got a great birds-eye view .
our city has many nice shots including this one over the highway .
the best spot is the beach where we took our next photo .
on the beach , there is a lone flag .
there is also a carnival near where we saw this wheel .
on our way home , we stopped by this structure to exercise .
we started off the day looking at some amusing street artists .
then , we headed down to the pier for some lunch .
our friend [male] joined us for a walk on the beach .
it was such a nice day that we needed to take off our shoes to enjoy the sand .
we finished the day riding the ferris wheel to see the ocean from up high .
we went to the beach on our vacation .
the beach was not far from our room , which were right on the water front .
we played on the beach .
we let the tide pull the sand away from our toes .
we even rode the ferris wheel before we went back to our room .
today we went on vacation to a city close to the beach .
while walking along the beach we found some beautiful homes next to the sand .
the day was sunny and so nice to be on the beach .
walking in the sand with the water hitting our feet felt so relaxing .
at the end of our day we came across an amusement park with a ferris wheel .
this figurine was left when the carnival left .
they also left this ride when they went out of business .
the wheel was the nicest part of the carnival .
the poles that supported the structure were so big .
the statue was auctioned off last week .
today we stumbled across an abandoned amusement park .
there was bare wiring everywhere it was very dangerous in hind sight .
there was alot of old rides and many sights to be seen .
as well as alot of old broken down attractions .
we waved our fairwell to the pig headed cartoon statue on our departure .
we were setting up the fair for its first day in time .
we had to test the rides .
some were scarier than others .
we also had to replace some of the lights .
when we finished , everything looked like fun .
my day at the theme park started with a warm welcome .
the coasters were empty and there were no lines .
i ended up on a platform i 'm normally not allowed to walk on .
this is the tallest attraction in the theme park .
it was n't until the end of the day that i realized this theme park was empty .
at the entrance of the park we came across this statue of a pig in a suit .
are are about to get on our favorite ride that spun us around so fast .
we took a picture of the roller coaster before we went up in the air .
this ride was so scary . it took us so high up in the air .
at the end of our day we found this interesting statue of a pharaoh .
a few of my friends met at a park the other day .
this was a roller coaster at the park .
we had to go up a long way to get to the top .
when we got off the other roller coaster , we went on this new one they had .
then we went to the restaurant and got a good meal before going home .
last night i broke the news ... we are going to the amusement park tomorrow !
they wouldnt believe me until we actually arrived .
unfortunatley the ride we were on got stuck upside down . we were there for 30 whole minutes ! talk about head rush .
they finally got us to a point where we could walk down .
we got home with a new found love for life and not being upiside down .
the party was filled with freshmen .
we decided to go ride coasters .
one coaster was very grand .
the second one was a little more exciting .
after coasters , we ate lunch outside .
here we all trying to make our plan of attack for our day at park .
we saw this from the parking lot . i got so hyped to be here right from the start .
walking up from the parking lot we saw this on when we where at the gate .
this is the first one we got on . when i saw it i knew that had made a good plan .
we had lunch together . we where talking about what was going to happen next .
my buddies and i got together and decided to visit the local theme park .
we had to sit down and wait for a couple guys .
i made everyone go on the biggest roller coaster there !
we were whooping on the way up and screaming on the way down .
some of the guys needed to sit down for a rest afterwards .
today we went to the winter carnival .
it was very chilly out so we stopped at organization for a hot cup of coffee .
next we went on the giant ferris wheel .
then we rode horses on the carousel .
before we left , we went on the ferris wheel one last time .
my mother and her friends were at the park the other day .
when the sun went down it seemed that the whole city lit up .
there was a display at this store that had everyone interested .
the line to get in was really long from what i heard .
but eventually everyone got in before they closed it and they all went home with a great memory .
at the venue , there we 're a lot of people .
many people laughed outside .
closer to the exit was this well lit wheel .
my friend wanted to ride the carousel .
i chose to ride the wheel twice .
we walked past this fair on the way to the movies .
we did not know that it was going to be so close to the theater .
everything was so big here . i did no know how i could take it all in . i just felt so small .
you could see the fair that was behind the theater .
here we are going to get some coffee , and to take a break from all of the walking we did .
for christmas eve we went down town to see the christmas tree .
many people were there to see it as well .
as an attraction the town put up a organization wheel near the dock and
a carousel .
we rode the ferris wheel multiple times .
my daughter smiled so hard in this photo .
the carnival was so fun yet so busy .
my wife was happy that we could finally vacation together .
my daughter turned around and thanked me for the trip .
we all slid down the slide together at the end .
today my daugher is with me so we ...
went to the street fair ! we got to ride the sky chairs .
she got a cartoon drawn .
we got carmal apple and she made sure to tell her mom she wasnt having too much sugar .
she was sad to leave but i reassured her we would be back soon .
i had fun today at the fair my grandma brought me and i am all smiles .
the fair is pretty big and all kinds of amusements .
here is my grandma getting us some of that great fair food .
after eating i would now recommend not going on the swings . they were still really fun though .
th gunny sack slide was fast and if you win the race you get a prize .
[female] was excited to go to the fair today .
we had to figure out first what we should do , since there was so much to do .
here we are waiting to get into the fair .
this was the first ride we went on for the day .
[female] was the most excited to go on this ride , so i took a picture of her from the bottom .
today was [female] 's first time visiting the local fair .
this year 's fair seemed bigger than the last .
even aunt [female] came all the way down here to join us .
[female] had fun on the huge swing and
the water slide .
a few of my friends invited me out to a festival a few days ago .
we went water skiing before we went to the festival .
my friend was a really good bike rider and showed us some neat tricks that day .
we finally made it to the festival and did all kinds of fun things .
we watched the fireworks display right before we went home .
at the lake , we saw this man skiing .
we went to the park to watch extreme sports .
after the park , my friends and i went to the carnival .
we rode the wheel together .
then we took a picture together to celebrate the night .
my friends and i went to the beach last week .
in the beginning of the day we rode water skis .
we then went bike riding and did tricks .
we came across a fair where they had a high organization wheel to ride on .
later , at the end of the night they hadfire works to end the show .
today is the 4th of july . its always been a family day for fun , carnivals , and fireworks to end the day . the family was excited to start the day .
first came watching water skiing and the stunt jumpers . although 14 year old ingvold insisted she was old enough to try , mom and dad felt differently . ice cream soothed ingvold 's upset and pouty face .
then , as they were enjoying the ice cream and working their way towards the rides , they came upon a stunt man on a simply built bicycle . they stopped and watched him for a while , and were totally amazed that he did n't hurt himself when performing some of those dangerous tricks .
upon arriving at the carnival , the family decided to go on some rides first , then play some quieter games , and then eat dinner . they agreed that having dinner first was not a good idea , because some of the rides could cause upset . ingvold especially enjoyed the dutch apple waffle that she had for dessert .
as it started to get dark , the family found a place to sit on the grass right near the water . they spread the blanket that dad had been carrying around all day , and sat down to enjoy the `` topping '' to their day . the town always put on a great fireworks display , and tonite was no exception . it was beautiful , exciting and colorful . people talked about the excitement for days afterward .
i made two friends in science and we wanted to hang out .
the boat went a lot faster than we anticipated .
we watched a professional bike rider do tricks at a park .
the amusement park had a lot of food that i ended up eating .
fireworks were the perfect way to end our day together .
the oktoberfest was so much fun this year !
there was german foods and of course , a lot of beer !
by the beer , there was a roller coaster called the `` munchun '' , that had many loops .
over by the food there was a little train that circled a gnome village .
but by far , the most exciting part of the day was riding on the tower of death !
this swing is really awesome to be under .
the coasters were very thrilling to watch and ride .
the wheel was enormous and i did not ride it .
the statue was beautiful and we took a picture with it .
the last stop was the garden which was nice to admire too .
me and the family spent the day at an amusement park and had a blast !
the lines were super long though unfortunately .
my brother was too afraid to get on this one but i dragged him on anway .
this was more my moms pace , still a nice little exhibit .
my brother is afraid of heights but again i pushed him on . time to man up buddy .
[male] and [male] went to a fair on friday .
there were lot of people there in the field .
a big roller coaster was set up in the middle of the fair .
there were also other ride to play on .
thankfully the last ride was the scariest ride that i refused to go on , was the one that went straight up and dropped down quickly .
this was opening day of the new amusement park .
people turned out in droves to see what the park had to offer .
the main draw of the park was the new curly mustache roller coaster .
for the young children , the park had an area for them to play .
the needle point ride was the most exciting ride for most people and the highest ride in the park .

[male] and his girl were going to spend the 4th of july at the amusement park .
they are loaded onto the ferris wheel , unaware that it was invented by a man named ferris in 1896 .
the view from the top and the peace they experience makes it a great ride .
after dark , the fireworks begin .
they rush to get closer because nothing beats a live view of fireworks . they have enjoyed themselves and thought about the birthday of our nation as they spent their day .
the day at the amusement park started with the silver streak .
the kids enjoyed the ferris wheel ride .
the next stop was the haunted castle .
the dragon ride was fun and the kids squealled the whole time .
the grand finale of the day was fireworks and sparklers . it was a great day .
i went down to visit an old amusement park one day .

at the fair , we found a fun spinning ride .
after that we rode the ferris wheel .

the ferris wheel is my favorite since i 'm not fond of roller coaster .
the line was long but we waited patiently to get on .
as night fell , the fireworks started up . they get more impressive every year .
i got creative by combining 2 photos . it needs more work , though .
we planned a surprise family reunion at the location location location .
mom and dad did n't suspect a thing .
the big surprise was all of their brother 's and sisters , grandchildren , nieces and nephews at our reserved tent .
the refreshments provided by the park were great .
the best part was having fun on the amusement park rides with everyone in the family .
we decided to take a trip to an amusement park with my parents .

the waves were beautiful at nighttime .
they had made a disco floor .
it was a lot of fun .
it was magical how the resort lit up at night .
lights were hidden throughout the facility , changing patterns often .
some patterns were even reflected on the small pond out front .
the whole area was a work of art at night .
this art is truly a masterpiece .
this is a beautiful scene with the lights and the beautiful .
the virgin [female] by the light speaks volumes .
this is a beautiful scene worth waiting for . epic .
i love the color scheme they used and how the lights hit it .
another epic scene and i have to say it 's even more beautiful here .
i wish i had my high school prom here , it was gorgeous .
there were beautiful marble statues around the site .
the beaches had the bluest water i 've ever seen .
the streets looked like something right out of a stage play .
do n't get me started on the dance floor , it looked like you were dancing on flowers .
the stage had many lights
and people singing .
it was bright outside
and the sidewalk was blue
with many red colors as well .
fourth of july at the water way is great .

i love to visit location . the city of love .
here is why it 's called the city of lights .
we always plan a trip to the location .
we also try out the rides at the local fair .

we were so excited to finally make it to location .
of course , we had to go to the location .
the pyramid looked so pretty at night .
the ferris wheel looked so pretty also , but we had our sights set on something greater .
we finally made it to the location location !
it was always my dream to see the eiffel tower , and on my vacation my dream came true .
the city seems to come alive at night time .
there are many friendly individuals that live in this city .
if i did not have a fear of heights , i would love to take a ride on the ferris wheel .
i went for an early morning stroll , and was surprised to not see the sun .
nothing is more symbolic of location than the location location .
however , we soon learned that location had much more to offer .
we spent eight hours at the location museum , but only saw about one-third of what the museum had to offer .
we also took a trip to organization organization , which was surprisingly enjoyable .
the taxis were on strike , so we traveled around the town mostly by metro .
i went to the fair last weekend .
there were a lot of people there .
it was hard to walk around .
the ferris wheel is huge .
i spent some time on the merry-go-round .
the family is having a fun time at the carnival .
they are looking for a ride to ride .
they look and see the merry go round and put their little sister on the ride .
after that they take a picture together .
after the picture it 's time to get some food to eat .
welcome to the carnival .
my brother and i decided to go with my friend and her boyfriend .
here they are trying to win a prize .
look how cute , they won !
i want to play the shooting game .
that evening we went to the local fair .
i invited my friends to come .
my girlfriend and i got separated from the group .
we ended up enjoying the fair together alone .
later we found our friends playing carnival games .
the fair is a very interesting place .
it is a place where friends can come together
and cultivate relationships .
sometimes you can go on rides with friends and see which ones are adventurous and fearless .
sometimes you can go on easier rides for relaxing fun and make memories .
when our baby finally arrived i took him for a walk around the neighborhood .
i had a great time .
i showed him all the nearby places .
and all the big buildings .
i also showed him nature .
the large circular building was seen from a distance behind the trees .
the gated building was magnificent .
the large tower was amazing on that beautiful day .
the exotic tropical trees skied above the ground .
the cocowalk was favorite place to go and hang out .
it was important to grab some shade on such a hot day .
there were some nice buildings along the way .
this structure in the distance was a real eye-grabber !
up close it was just as majestic .
and the landscaping was amazing , truly a fun day .
the day was beautiful , the family decided to walk around town and enjoy the day .
the old plantations were fun to look at .
the old fountain in the middle of the road was fun for the kids to splash around in .
the boys thought the old trees would be fun to climb up in .
it was time for lunch .
this scene was absolutely breath taking !
after that , we strolled by this elegant house !
then we walked by this beautiful tower !
later on we went by this gorgeous road !
and finally we stopped at this wonderful place !
it was time for the winter wonderland festival .

the carnival rides for the kids young and old were festive and brightly lit .
winter wonderland again this year .
the angels sang and lit up ,
while the lights all around shone .
we picked up some knick knacks ,
before getting on the ferris wheel .
walking in a winter wonder land , the song played in her head .
oh the angels , how cute .
the lights .
she could find unusual gifts .
and of course the rides .
i love fireworks .
boom boom pow .
wow that is pretty .
i love the sounds .
it was epic .
the firework was unreal as it magically exploded in the air .
the multiple fired shots of fireworks is seen launching .
the fireworks were intense and very bright .
many different fireworks clustered together in a breathtaking view .
a lone firework lit up that magical night .
we enjoyed the fireworks show . this one looks like the top of a palm tree .
this firework seems a bit scattery .
it 's always great when they shoot off a whole bunch of them at once .
the smokey background makes this firework even more awesome .
the bent ends on this one make it appear as a multi legged creature .
it was 4th of july weekend and the fireworks were ready .
there were so many different kinds of fireworks .
there was one that looked like mini spiders .
there was also ones that looked like giant palm trees .
overall , the fireworks were spectacular .
the fireworks were huge
and many bright colors .
they made static
and were very impressive
in the night sky .
the fireworks were gorgeous .
i bought a new camera for the event .
i wanted to capture them as clearly as possible .
it was a lot of fun .
afterward it was very smoky .
watching fireworks is an experience
there are so many different kinds
the colors are breath taking
and you never know what you will see
i hope to see more later
i went to the fireworks show the other night .
i had a great time watching the brilliant colors in the sky .
the red ones were y favorite , since that is the color i like the most .
i also liked the ones that had multiple bursts in them , as they are the loudest too .
it was just a really nice and entertaining way to spend an evening with some friends .
the fireworks started big .
every moment was as epic as the last .
you kept expecting it to slow down .
but then it would just get bigger .
finally , the last big firework went off .
the fireworks started right after dark .
our bellies were full from our delicious barbeque earlier .
while enjoying the beautiful show , someone flew a drone overhead .
i hope the drone owner posts the video online .
i 'd love see this again from a different perspective .
as i set aside and listened to the long whistles and booms along came red .
long dashes of blue spreading long and high across the sky .
high dashes of rainbows cleared the sky .
the sky was beautifully lit up with a rainbow of colors .
once that line of dashes was over bright blue colored round shot abouts started .
we saw an incredible fireworks display
it was the best i have ever seen
i will always remember it
there were so many colors
it was just amazing
the city is hosting a fireworks display .
people from all the surrounding towns have come to watch the display .
the 4th of july displays are always very popular .
the grand finale is happening in this shot .
a lot of work was put into this year 's fireworks display .
there are hardly many visual displays quite like fireworks .
their explosive characteristics make them unpredictable by nature .
some fireworks are bursting with color
while others simply light up the sky .
fireworks are a celebratory display that appropriately capture the mood .
the family went to local fireworks show on the 4th of july .
the display was really amazing .
it got surprisingly bright with all of the fireworks going off .
the show lasted for over an hour .
the grand finale was really a spectacle to behold .
i had a great day in location .
i got some of my favorite food , from my favorite restraunt .
then i went to a great little store .
later i walked long the river .
at the end of the day i met my girlfriend [female] at a concert in the park .
we just went on our first trip to location location !
here is xiong in front of the temple !
here is ming eating dinner in location location .
xiong was excited to be in front of this convenience store .
later , we went to a huge concert and had so much fun !
today i met char for the first time .
here he is in front of the shinobi house .
he took this photo of me eating egg rolls .
and look , here he is in front of the organization organization store .
we ended the night by going to a [male] bieber concert .
enjoying some time with my boyfriend .
my boyfriend just got out of class .
dinner time ! i love eating at this restaurant .
time to do some shopping .
enjoying a concert to end a wonderful day out .
spending time in the city was fun .
we ate so much .
the shops were unique .
the city has a ton of buildings .
we enjoyed time to rest .
inside the light show , it was an amazing sight .
the lights were disorienting and people seem confused .
especially , the little baby boy !
torrie had enough and began looking for an exit .
and she was so happy when she finally made it outside .
[male] went to play in the tunnels with his friends .
inside the tunnels it was colorful and dark .
the tunnels were long and [male] thought he was going to get lost .
he found his friends at the end of one of the tunnels .
the coolest part of the tunnels to [male] was the design of the patterns inside the tunnels .
we visited a festival with an unusual funhouse .
the lights were pretty cool but it was very odd .
i 'm not sure if he was enjoying it or bored by it .
the floor was soft so you could scoot around on your behind or lay on the floor .
from the outside , it did n't look that unusual .
the play pit is well lit .
i do n't mind the children playing .
they love it .
it is a lot of fun for little work .
outside you would never know this place exists .
there were many people at the event
and there were pretty colors .
there were greens
and reds
and blue lines .
a view of the satellites on top of the building .
the satellites were heavily secured by barb wired fencing .
the satellite from behind appears to be facing the sun .
the warnings of the are are displayed by the sign .
the three satellites are seen from a distance with the building in the background .
this is organization satellites .
they are searching for intelligent life in space .
hoping there is some aliens somewhere out there listening .
the future is now with this amazing technology .
the team at organization is very proud of their work .
amazing how big these things are .
boy security around here is not to be messed with
the question remains `` did et phone home ? ''
sign is very hard to read .
how far away from civilization this place is .
we took the weekend off to visit one of the oldest satellite stations in location .
the satellites were all pointing the same direction .
it was definitely a beautiful sight .
fortunately , it was a nice and beautiful day outside .
we took many pictures of the dishes .
the dishes were massive
and on the buildings .
they were looking out to the sky
and they were easy to see
because of how big they were .
we went to location location to enjoy a baseball game .
i was rooting for my favorite team the organization organization organization .
we enjoyed a nice father daughter day at the game .
we had great seats right near the home plate .
the food was also great .
i went to the stadium today .
i wanted to see the ball game .
there were many people in the stands .
everyone wanted the game to begin .
it was an exciting match .
we got to the stadium and waited .
it took forever just to get inside .
once there , we found our seats .
the baseball game began and the crowd cheered .
we got some food and watched the game .
arriving at location park for the big game and i ca n't wait .
here we are in the arena and it 's even more beautiful in person .
selfie flick and we are loving this game .
play ball ! the stadium was packed like it should be .
what 's a ball game without without a hot dog ! yum ! ! !
excitement was high for the game to start .
the jumbotron caught everyone 's attention , but most of the focus was still on the game .
these two ha a lot of fun bonding over the day !
the seats were great , very close to the action .
and of course the food was very tasty !
when visiting location , we went to a quirky amusement park .
a popular ride there was the ferris wheel .
one attraction was an old time movie theater which had a piped organ that played .
there was also a spooky haunted house .
my favorite was the disco speed ride . the cars raced quickly around the track while popular disco songs played . it was the most unique amusement park i had ever been to .
the fair was the place to be at this time of year .
we played games and won stuffed animals for the children .
inside of the haunted mansion there were freaky statues that actually seemed to stare at us .
we decided to go on a kiddie ride after that .
and [female] got her picture taken before we left .
the carnival was a visual masterpiece this year .
the ferris wheel was huge , bigger than last year .
the funhouse was cool , but creepy looking .
the inside was very creepy ! there was a mannequin that we thought was real !
at the end of the night we rode the ferris wheel , and looked down at all the bright and beautiful lights .
the murky lighting gave the place a cool atmosphere .
there were many prizes to win and fun to be had .
this was a bit creepy , i had to say !
but a lot of the designs were really intricate and cool .
this one in particular was a favorite .
there were stunt cars .
games for people of all ages .
of course the haunted house was always a big hit .
activities for the young children .
and of course the children .
our cruise landed us at location harbor for the day .
we toured the sites and took many photos including this amusement park on the waterfront .
we went on a tour of the harbor on a boat just like the this one .
we cruised past the location harbor bridge .
where we waited for sunset to capture this wonderful image of the famous location opera house .
there is a long bridge connecting the two cities .
the city is located right next to the water .
visitors can take a boat to visit the city .
another option is to drive over the bridge .
at night , the building looks very shining and white in the moon light .
the river ride was peaceful .
we passed by the city ,
on our way across the bay .
we went under the bridge .
headed to the organization organization organization .
we crossed the bridge into the city .
it looked amazing while we did .
off to the side , we could see boats in the bay .
the bridge itself was a sight to behold .
we got into the city , and saw some of the local sites .
initially , it appeared that the weather would not cooperate with our boat tour .
however , the clouds cleared and we got to see beautiful views of the skyline .
we ventured around the city to see many sites .
as we passed under a bridge , we came upon the highlight of the tour .
we got to see the location location location .
flying into location the view is so spectacular !
i love to see the skyline .
my fist stop is always the organization organization organization .
and of course we have to visit the space needle .
location at night is a wonder to behold . i ca n't wait to come back .
i went to the city last weekend .
there was a lot of traffic .
the sky was very cloudy .
when i got to the pier it cleared up a little .
but i could still see some storm clouds ahead .
this is our landing to location for the annual trip .
this is the river bank where we stayed ,
and here is the public market that was the concert venue .
location is very beautiful .
this is the cityline at night .
the scenery was breathtaking .
the city looked so nice from afar .
the streets were welcome to new visitors .
iconic areas still stood strong .
at night it looked so great all lit up .
the view from the plane is breathtaking .
the skyline is absolutely fantastic .
on our way to check out the market center .
the view from here makes me feel tiny .
the night skyline is magical .
we decided to have a bonfire .
by nightfall , our fire for the bonfire was pretty noticeable .
it kept growing larger and larger .
the fire was enchanting as it grew .
it was so enchanting we decided to light fireworks and dance around it .
getting ready to celebrate the 4th of july on the beach .
started the evening with a fish bake and grill .
flares were lit to start the festivities .
a great bonfire soon developed .
just in time for the true fireworks .
we went to a party on the beach to celebrate the new year !
someone started a bonfire .
the winds kicked it up a notch .
we were n't sure it was going to be safe to stand too close to ! this was n't your average bonfire !
then it was time for fireworks , which were n't nearly as dangerous as that bonfire !
it was time to view an awesome fireworks show !
we were ready for an awesome spectacle !
we watched as the fireworks blazed through the sky !
the sky was filled with so many colors !
the fireworks exploded and left us in awe ! what a wonderful trip !
location location was such a peaceful place the morning of july 4 .
we barbecued an entire pig in the afternoon and partied with family and friends .
sadly , the night turned ugly as the fireworks on the beach set some nearby brush on fire .
the fire quickly got out of control .
who would have thought that something as beautiful as this could turn so ugly ?
a group of tourists came to a new city to explore .
they were excited to try all different kinds of exotic foods .
a chef cooked their dinner right in front of them .
they were able to select what food they wanted fresh .
they ate their dinner outside on the city streets .
visiting the town .
the restaurant where we will eat at .
the chef serving the food .
pineapple fruit desert .
night life in location .
we had a long way to go before we got to the food .
but the very first meal was worth it , even if i could n't name most of the pieces .
the vendors helped me and in return , i gladly bought what i could eat .
everything looked so good and hot .
after sitting down for a real meal , it was sad to think the night was over .
my first trip out of the country was fun . my wife was my guide .
she told me to just jump on in and try the cuisine . i was leery of the street vendors .
this outdoor restaurant was very popular , and my wife assured me the food was safe and delicious .
they did have a clean restaurant . everything was spotless .
here is a view of the outdoor restaurant from the corner of the street .
on our vacation we visited this historic town in the mountains .
we decided to visit a local food district recommended by a guide .
the dishes were prepared right in front of us , they all looked delicious .
dessert helped complete the meal .
we went dancing at a night club after dinner .
me and my girl friends went on a trip to location .
the lights in the city were so bright and beautiful .
even the organization sign was lit up with brilliance .
we decided to go to the casino and spend more money .
inside the casino was even more beautiful .
the casino was up in lights in the night time .
the casino entrance was illuminated and easy to find .
the carpet was red and fancy .
inside the main room , the tile had a yellow glow .
one of the buildings had a teal glow on the outside .
location location has a bustling light life .
people come from all over the location to gamble .
there are other things to do in location location as well .
there are shows , restaurant , and shops .
overall location location is a popular vacation spot .
it was time for location location ! !
they were very excited to see all the lights and to gamble the night way .
even the organization 's sign was all sparkly .
it was time to check into the hotel .
the lobby was huge and led them to the casino to gamble !
i go to location location at least once a year and always stay at location location .
that 's not to say there are n't other great places on the location location strip .
i simply like location location best because it is across the street from a 24-hour organization 's .
during my last trip to location location i actually spent the majority of my time gambling at the mgm grand .
the mgm grand is gorgeous on the inside and makes you feel like you are enormously wealthy .
i went to work today .
my office building was recently built .
there were some fancy designs in it .
i really like it .
it 's my new favorite place .
location has some of the most visually stunning hotels
its almost like being in a video game
i ca n't believe how trippy it is
i would go there again
and the outside is incredible
the textures and shapes of this building 's inside design was really intriguing .
the pillars used a theme of curved etchings in glass that were lighted from behind .
the wave patterns created a sense of movement in the ceiling .
the offset light fixtures at the edges of the circles made it feel like one was in a planetarium .
this is me after taking pictures all day .
the hotel lobby was very modern .
there were beautiful pieces of art all over .
even the lights on the ceilings were art .
[male] looked up at the ceiling in his room .
he was happy he picked such a beautiful place to stay .
stunning , simply stunning .
it almost looked like a city at night .
but it was his newest achievement .
designed 100 % by none other than him .
this should cement his place among the likes as [male] [male] wright .
the building we were in was very weird .
i could n't find my way around .
it was very strange .
i got lost many times .
it was a lot of fun .
today we are attending an indoor light show .
the colors created by this light show seem like a real life spider web .
this one puzzled me , however , the bright colors entice me .
thus one seemed to take on a life like format .
i got a bit uneasy with this one , as it was reminiscent of a mammogram
these were some pictures i took in a dome near my home .
the inside looked like you were on drugs . it looked pretty cool .
everyone blending in with each other . i almost lost everyone !
where did you go ? some on guys..
the place overall was very cool .
there once was a dumpy place .
it transformed into a vortex of color .
the vortex was constantly changing .
it was nearing the end .
and you could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel .
we decided to check out an art installation this past weekend .
it was very unique and creative .
and maybe a little bit bizarre .
we walked around inside of it so i guess we were part of the show .
it blew my mind and inspired me to be more creative .
fireworks over organization are some of the best fireworks .
there wre all different colors . my husband liked the white ones the best .
my son liked the bluish ones .
my daughter liked the zig zag ones , no matter the colors .
my favorite ones were the starburst fireworks .
we embarked on the river in our small boats .
we rode all night until we were too tired to go any farther .
we rested at a seaside shack ... i watched for the fish .
and , then we resumed our trip and pulled into the bridge that night and had the view we had wished for all along .
when we returned to the shack that night ... i felt blessed for the day .
we followed along the fence .
it was pretty flimsy and old .
we got to the garden looked around a bit .
then headed on the road toward the river .
we hung out there until nightfall .
the water 's is so calm at this time of night .
i love the way the sun shine 's across the water .
whoa , the banister 's about to fall apart .
the lit up bridge looks great with all the colors .
looking at the calm water to help relax me
i went with my friend to ride on a boat .
we rode until later afternoon just as the sun was setting .
we passed by an old iron bridge that looked worn down .
the bridge towered above us lighting up the dark sky .
we decided to row back home and pass by the old iron bridge again .
the entrance showed another picture of the famous chef .
we went down the escalator to make our way outside .
on the way we passed the hard rock cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© .
we made it out to where the ferry was waiting .
before boarding i took another photo with the famous chef .
there is a poster on the city wall advertising a new cafe .
the buildings on the streets have big lighted up logos .
there is even a boat lighted up with green lights on the water .
next to the water , there is a ferris wheel .
at night , the organization wheel is very bright and can be seen from a far distance .
i was so excited to try the food .
i had to save enough room to hold food from the location location location , of course .
after we left , a green-light ship caught my attention .
then i relaxed and watched the light in the distance .
as we retired for the night , i looked back to remember how beautiful the city was .
last night i had some good chinese food .
then i went to hard rock for some drinks .
after that i explored the city and saw this beautiful boat .
next i took a ride on the ferris wheel .
the skyline looked gorgeous .
he had heard that this was one of the best places to eat .
the setting was wonderful .
they had a hard rock cafe that he wanted to try the next night .
the boat was fun to eat on .
he got a picture with a picture of his favorite chef .
during the day , hamsot , location is a quiet , respectable city .
it is home to many historical buildings .
however , at night , it becomes quite a party city . there are restaurants and pubs all along the street .
the city becomes aglow with lights .
there 's even a colorful ferris wheel . it 's such an interesting place to visit .
we stayed at a beautiful house downtown .
we immediately went to see the decorations , i loved the blue tree there .
i love watching buildings like this .
once it got dark , it was even more beautiful .
the lights were everywhere , it really looked great !
on our tour , we saw grand old houses from a bygone era .
this old architecture is not just great but very artistic in nature .
the night neon city lights have a warm feel about as we walked beneath .
the lights reflecting on the water gave us a calm feeling .
the other neon lights of the carnival rides gave us a feeling of festivity and fun !
this city has magnificent buildings and houses where people live here for the night life .
there are big buildings and awesome opportunities in this city .
the night life here there are a lot of things to do .
the lights and people that come here to visit is abundant .
there are fairs and festivals all the time . there is never not something to do for people of all ages .
the house was old
but the tree was pretty .
there were many old homes
by the big ferris wheel
in the colorful district .
we took the boys out for a family day-out .
we went to the carnival and rode rides .
our oldest son rode with his mom on the tea cup .
our youngest son rode with dad .
they had a great time .
the family visits an bemusement park .
little [male] can hardly contain his excitement inside the ride .
dad and little [male] on the ride together .
life could n't get much better than this [male] thought .
after the ride the two brothers posed for a picture .
i took my two sons to the carnival .
they rode the carousel a bunch of times .
we had a lot of fun on the rides !
my husband had a lot of fun , too .
it was a great day spent as a family .
i promised my sons we 'd go to the park .
they were excited to ridge the carousel .
next we rode the tilt-a-whirl .
we had a lot of fun .
the best part was seeing the smiles on my son 's faces .
lil [male] 's dream was finally becoming a reality . he was gon na ride a carousel .
[male] smiled at the camera as he waited for the teacup he was sitting in to begin moving .
he saw other people in the seats around him holding on tightly .
as the ride started [male] tried to force himself to maintain a smile .
when the ride ended [male] could only stare and consider how disappointing the carousel had been .
the bridge led to the city where we were visiting that day .
the streets were empty in the deserted town .
the trees were seen next to the lakes on the cold day .
the old deserted building once stood proud .
a statue carved in wood near some exotic plants .
i stumbled upon a ghost town today .
the bridge leading to it was completely devoid of cars .
the lawns and houses had objects , but no people . so i began worrying about what happened .
there was a story everywhere in this town .
eventually i had to pull out my camera and take photos .
we started up the road towards the ghost town .
as we left the city , we noted the last person we saw the entire day .
as we passed the lake , we felt peaceful and serene .
the ghost town was finally upon us . the dead trees gave us the feeling right away .
we finally found what we were looking for , the omega face in the ghost town .
i went on a vacation to a quiet town .
lots of the buildings had a lot of character .
the lake near my hostel was gorgeous .
this building looked sort of eerie .
i am not sure what this statue meant but it looked cool .
we drove from the airport in location to a small town in location .
unsurprisingly , i could n't read any of the signs .
it was okay though because we were less interested in the local businesses than we were in nature .
i really wanted to go up to this building to see what was inside but did n't have the guts .
someone awfully talented must live in that building though because this sculpture is awesome .
at the amusement park , they could see the roller coaster in the distance .
there many were brightly colored balloons hung in the tree .
the house that they passed by had brightly colored paint .
they kept walking until they reached a grassy field .
two couples were seen in the distance near the gazebo .
this is the coolest coaster .
it 's located in another country though .
the have a celebration tree .
when babies are born they do the same with pacifiers .
ending the evening looking out at the water helps you wind down .
if one looks thinks of art as anything and everything , it makes life a bit more fun .
seeing the art in national symbols helps develop our vision of those nations .
seeing a tree and filling it with art brings a little more life to the natural beauty of things .
some art is very vague
while others is just the natural art of life .
a day in the country with my family
balloons filled the tree with color
the old house with the red color was very nice .
i liked this plant it seemed very different .
finally we relaxed in the gazebo .
just looking at this ride made us dizzy
this was such a great idea .
not sure if a house or a barn .
these little flowers were all over the place .
taking a break at the end of the day .
i had a great time on vacation .
there were very strange buildings nearby .
the ferris wheel was white .
it was also huge .
i bought some souvenirs while i was there .
[female] went into the city to take some pictures she snapped one of this art on the wall .
next she took this picture of a clock in the fog .
after that she stepped back and took another photo of the downtown area .
after that she headed over and snapped a picture of the ferris wheel .
after that she see this amazing painting in an art museum and she had to take a picture .
early in the morning , i woke up in my hotel , ready to start my new journey in the foreign city .
i first visited the business center , which glowed under the morning fog . i ate a quick breakfast at the cafe in one of the buildings .
i enjoyed a fun day wandering around the city , until it grew dark . i found the ferris wheel and started to take pictures of it .
the ferris wheel was large and looming , a stark white against the night sky . it was immobile for the night , so i got a lot of great pictures .
at the end of the day , i returned to my hotel room and thought about my next journey . i would be going to the city 's historical site to see ancient carvings . i was pretty excited .
she was an artist .
she got inspiration from every where , including the sky .
or a skyline .
lights in particular .
carvings often gave her new ideas .
the room was dimly lit as they looked up at their window .
overlooking the city at night is beautiful .
capturing huge structures that 's so grand .
the gigantic ferries wheel they all wanted to get on .
ancient structures that 's on a wall .
i went out today .
i saw some electricity .
i also bought an egg robot .
when i was heading back i saw a bathtub .
i bought a spoon full of buttons .
[female] makes crafts and sells them at the flea market .
she has made some very interesting crafts and made quite the profit .
a recent craft she made sold for five hundred dollars .
one of her projects is even on display in a museum .
her latest project is for sale now at the local flea market where she hopes to cash in big .
this was my first day making household art .
here was my first piece . i call it `` cheerleader in peril ''
this one was based on the thought that gears are in our heads .
this was made using nothing but cereal boxes .
look at these buttons that were left over , those could be nice to use on a dress .
we were walking back to our hotel .
then we saw lightning flow across !
back inside , we worked on an egg .
and went to the amusement park section .
and ate buttons for breakfast , yum !
i was vacationing in location location and decided to kick off my sight seeing by going to a hands on musuem where i got to use a computer .
i enjoyed looking at the modern art at the museum .
there were many interesting pieces of art in the museum that were similar , yet different .
i really liked this example of architecture that was on display .
at the end of the day i went back to my hotel and looked through my collection of small buttons that i like to bring with me when i travel .
after the fundraising there was a dance that our band played at .
the guitar player was having a good night and wowed the audience .
the drummer had no problem laying down the perfect beats .
the band was really playing tight that evening .
the acoustics in the room were perfect for our band and music .
we went to see our local band last night .
the guitarist played his soul out .
the drummer was very talented .
[female] watched the show in awe .
at the end of the show the lead guitarist threw his guitar to the floor and played it .
went to a club and saw the weirdest thing . a wonder wheel , spin it and win soemthing .
got to finally get in and saw a guitar playing band .
they sang really good songs .
see , i was way into this .
the love ballad got me hooked . i want the cd .
first the singer took the stage .
then the guitar ripped out .
the drummer was last and brought the sound together .
we watched in aw of the performance .
the performers did great and the show went on .
the band performed admirably on stage .
the guitarist in the band played with exception precision .
the drumming kept the beat impeccably as the others played off of his cadence .
fans in the audience were taken back by how much their music resonated .
following the concert . the guitarist began packing up his equipment .
there are so many things to see down by the beach .
they have many very old buildings .
they even have a working trolley system .
the view of the water is amazing here .
it is a really great day to be outside !
it 's fun to enjoy the sites and lights on the boardwalk .
the old rides and sites on the boardwalk evoke a happier time .
the ocean view in the distance is always worth stopping for .
the ocean in the background , the blue sky and white clouds make a perfect background for odd structures .
if the owner wants to get our attention as we stroll on the boardwalk , he has surely done it with this oddity .
we were greeted by this giant train ride when we arrived at the boardwalk .
theres were a lot of cool vintage signs all over .
this is a picture of the ghost train ride that goes around the boardwalk .
the view from the pier is breathtaking .
i took a final picture befoe we left for the day .
first we visited a ride called the ghost train .
then we came to a museum that had many interesting things inside .
we passed by a double decker bus on the road .
after that we visited the beach .
we took pictures to remember our day .
the place was large
and had blue .
the people walked
and saw the vast open
before taking photos .
i went on vacation and took some amazing photos
check out this beautiful flower
i love cactuses so i took this photo too
is n't this a beautiful unique flower plant
i loved photographing this beautiful butterfly
this butterfly is at a cactus garden in location .
there are a lot of pretty flowers this time of year .
other cactus are just nice to look because of their shapes .
some can be more threatening than others if you were to fall on them .
this cactus can grow to be over 10 feet tall if left undisturbed .
my biology class when on a field trip yesterday .
some of the cactus flowers .
we also saw normal looking cactus .
i was shocked to discover there are white cactus .
we also saw many butterflies .
the bee makes it 's way towards a lovely yellow desert flower .
the cactus has decided to grace the landscape with a pink flower .
this cactus has many different sharp spines .
this cactus looks to have a white flower structure .
the butterfly is thirsty for nectar and searches this flower for some .
today we visited a greenhouse . we saw a bee collection pollen !
i loved the color of this flower .
there were so many cacti !
this plant looked strange . i wonder what it was ?
and here 's a butterfly that we saw on another one of the flowers .
we had a a great kick off to the conference
the audience seemed to enjoy the program
we were able to honor some for their achievements
the honorees were able to tell a bit of their story
we wrapped up the day with a special invited guest
the presenter came prepared to talk about `` connect euranet . ''

me and [female] had a date at the waterpark .
the water sprayed me so hard i almost lost my trunks .
[female] thought i looked scary as a pirate .
the live music was incredible and made me think of college .
i just wanted one ice cream cone before we left .
my brother and my son took a picture outside of the hall .
my wife was very happy to be with us on that day .
in the living room , we played with clay and shared jokes .
my dad lit the fire as we sang in harmony .
the next morning , we went to church as a family .
it 's the day of the family reunion and everyone is on the way to the house for lunch .
all the cousins posed for a picture !
all the family is here and everyone is excited .
lunch was delicious !
after lunch , everyone played a board game .
today was the day of [male] 's family reunion .
all of [male] 's family got together to exchange stories and catch up .
for [male] 's great grandmother , this was a day she looked forward to every year .
the family enjoyed a home cooked dinner .
the kids put together a drawing to remember their day with their family .
that 's a picture of me and my older brother , [male] .
my sister sometimes gets confused when people take her picture .
[male] and i made clay dolls in the kitchen .
our father , [male] , lit the fire up to warm the house .
church was our final activity for the night .
today we took a car ride to see our friends and family .
when we got there we were greeted by some old friends .
we had a chance to sit down and get caught up with our family .
when it was dinner time we prepared a large meal for everyone .
after dinner we made small animals out of clay .
our hotel was well furnished .
we traveled to the church to pray before doing anything next .
we went the beach afterwords to take a partner picture .
my wife then took an individual picture of me .
we had breakfast for dinner that day and it was amazing .
we got a vacation house by the beach for the summer .
we had a nice close view oof the ocean where we ate .
you could also see it from the front door !
we spent alot of timt together walking the beach .
when we werent back at the house making ourselves at home .
once again this year we rented our beach house for the summer .
it had a lovely deck around the back were we could eat outside .
the views from all angles were wonderful .
we liked walking on the beach in the evening .
and at the end of the busy day , we would make a great dinner to eat and relax .
we took a vacation at a bed and breakfast not far from the ocean .
not too far away we came across a beautiful chapel that was empty .
since it was such a nice day we decided to take our photo standing next to the beach .
the view from the place we stayed at was so wonderful .
before heading back home we had a large breakfast .
the beach side villas were a great getaway for my wife and i .
we enjoyed lunch on the patio every afternoon .
there were grasslands all around the inland .
the beach had sand that was softer than toilet paper .
dinner and a movie is the perfect way to wind down the day .
in this plain , we were thinking about building a home .
we traveled to a nearby beach to clear our mind .
when we returned home , we checked our mail .
turning around , we realized we already had a nice home and a nice view .
at the local park , we rested at this beautiful spot .
we were so bored . life was hum-drum .
wow ! we got a letter from my aunt inviting us to visit her in location .
spent all day sight-seeing . what quaint cobblestone streets . a real sense of history here .
relaxing after a busy day .
we stayed at this cute bed & breakfast inn and had a wonderful time .
the newlywed couple on the front porch of their new house
the house needed some work , but it was perfect for them
he worked a short walk away through the quaint town .
in the early evenings they would sit by the water and enjoy each other 's company
sometimes they would look at newer , larger homes and imagine their promising future .
the grass in location is always green .
the ocean in location can sometimes be a pale blue .
this is the mailbox of my house when i was a kid .
my view from the front lawn of the old house is spectacular .
i got married with the ocean surrounding me .
when traveling to the place we were staying at we came across a lush green field .
not too far from where we were staying at beautiful view of a beach on a cloudy day .
we stayed at the house numbered 106 .
the view not far from our place was overlooking the lake .
there was a dock with a pavilion in the lake that was so scenic .
i got breakfast at the sup shop two days ago .
these men are always good to me in the morning .
i stopped by the job to check on the construction job .
then i stopped by the university to pick up my car .
i drove to the shore and took another beautiful picture .
the front side of the fish and bait store that we love so much .
behind the counter the add up the total for today and yesterday .
the view from the front side of the property .
big brick buildings stand tall on this side of town .
the ocean calls to most men , but only the sea hardy heed the call .
my friend opened a restaurant in the town i live in .
i went to go visit him to see how it was going .
he was located across from a organization so he had some good clientele coming in .
the school was expensive and maybe his clients would come to his establishment .
that night was going to be his test of his restaurant and it looked good for him .
[male] always orders two bagels at the diner .
[male] is the manager who makes sure his food is extra good .
the neighborhood around the diner is dirty and desolate .
a nearby school has that classic urban look .
[male] sat at the beach until the sun went down .
before touring the college campus , we decided to eat at organization organization organization organization organization restaurant .
we both ordered an open faced roast beef sandwich .
after lunch we arrived at the southern entrance of campus , where they were constructing a new building .
the physics building was especially beautiful . i could n't wait to see the inside .
the beach was a one mile hike through the woods . i am looking forward to going swimming there !
my husband was telling us the facts about his plant .
near the shop , i took a picture of my wife .
then , we took a picture together when we got to the beach .
she made a lovely sand castle .
back at home , i played guitar for her sister and brother .
my husband is a real home guy , but i 've got to get him out of the house .
a weekend trip was just the thing . this is me , visiting the antique shops . fun , but sore feet .
hubby had fun building a sand castle .
it sure is quite a walk to the water , but i 'll go wading anyway .
a fun couple we met this weekend . we exchanged phone numbers and plan to keep in touch .
oh snap , i thought i bought some marajuana seeds , but the plant itself says otherwise .
this girl i met , she was gon na buy lots of weed off me , but i could n't sell her any because i was growing tomato plants .
but , we hung out anyway by going out to the beach .
she is hella pretty , i think i 'm gon na ask her to marry me .
boom , we got married and had two kids that are now teenagers .
arriving at the bed and breakfast they loved the beautiful plants and decor .
they first visited the town and did some window shopping .
next they took advantage of the weather and went to the beach .
the man was very proud of the sand castle he constructed .
in the evening they socialized with the other guests over music and common interests .
[male] has loved plants ever since watching discovery channel
his girlfriend , [female] , sits near a plant store waiting for location to finish .
location loves to build things in the sand with his own hands .
[female] posed for a picture , as if to say hi .
[female] was happy that [male] found his guitar and returned it .
the skyline in the country is very grey and overcast .
the clouds do n't stop when they come rolling in .
the big bearded man is the last word here in these parts .
putting together this structure takes some time but will be worth it .
spinning the wheel is a part of it but i ca n't wait to see what happens .
we went down to the lake yesterday .
we were visiting uncle [male] who was building a deck to get to his boat .
the deck had lots of steps to get up to it .
and , the deck was really long .
we were glad to see uncle [male] was making so much progress .
the notion was clear and fresh .
looking into the sky , i planned my day .
my family came over to chat with me .
together , we built a model .
the fan was attached towards the end .
we spent a day on a local lake .
it was kind of cloudy , but still nice .
my uncle was there as well .
he showed me an old dock that we owned .
the dock needed some work , though .
the land that we purchased to build our house on was near a beautiful lake .
the shore was a very short walk from our property .
the contractor that we hired was a very knowledgeable guy who had 20 years in the business .
he set up a temporary platform to hold his materials and to work from .
the platform could be raised and lowered with a wheel .
[male] liked going to the alligator reservation .
everyone had to make sure not to get eaten .
the alligators usually stayed in this pond .
you could see the alligators from close up .
everyone had a good time watching the alligators in their natural habitat .
the woman was reading the sign that said `` caution , alligators . ''
the couple took a picture on the bridge by the alligator pond .
the alligator was swimming in the pond .
the men were setting up a picnic .
the couple had lunch at the alligator farm .
he was tempted to jump into the water .
she stopped to read the sign .
the water was covered in floating plants .
the alligator laid in the shade .
they posed together in front of the sign .
we started our hike by passing the lake .
we stopped long enough to see the signs .
the swamp we passed from there was so vast .
i even saw an alligator .
we got back onto land and headed home .
she had wanted to visit the bayou for the longest time .
when she arrived , she carefully read the sign about the alligators .
at first she saw nothing but marshland .
then , all of a sudden she saw an enormous alligator that was at least eight feet long .
when she was ready to leave the park , she and a friend posed for a photo .
the couple took a vacation at the seaside .
there was a lot to do there .
of course , there was a beach close by .
they got their picture taken in front of the ocean .
then they visited other local attractions .
we went to the seaside club for a much deserved vacation .
the resort was gorgeous and we loved it .
they had the most amazing well maintained tennis courts .
we were right by the beach too , so that was an extra perk .
the rooms were great too , so comfortable and inviting !
we started our grand journey at this lovely white house .
it had a sign in front that pointed us in the right direction .
the entire seaside was full of people and energy .
my wife and i decided to take a picture by our view .
i hugged the tree because i was grateful to nature .
at the hotel constantine , love was always in the air .
the resort was rife with activities ... but few people partook in any of them .
instead , they canoodled and cavorted on the beach .
new romances were forged quickly and passionately .
some `` relationships '' were a little more unusual than others . but [male] , the tree-hugger , could n't have been happier .
the resort was beautiful even from a distance .
we planned to do all of the activities .
i could n't wait to hit the beach .
i hugged my wife tight the whole trip long .
i did n't even want to leave , they had to pry me off of the tree .
went on vacation this summer and had a lovely time .
seeing the shipwrecked boats was quite a sight !
the view from the shore was beautiful . the birds were huge .
the streets however were a little rundown .
overall we had a great time and met a lot of wonderful people .
docking the boat was a bit of a challenge but we made it !
palm trees grow all over the place here .
seeing the sky while it 's clear of clouds was so nice .
the beach is so dry this time of year .
i ca n't wait until this boat is ready for the water .
our boat started in the harbor .
we saw several model boats displayed .
the birds swarmed our location .
outside of our home was a bit of garbage .
we decided not to clean but go to the beach instead .
a group of friends went to explore a marina after a big storm .
there were some boats that had broken away from their moorings and crashed .
this is a view of the harbor from a restaurant .
boats had even washed up on shore and crashed into apartment buildings .
the friends walked along the beach for a bit looking at debris .
the village relied on fishing for most of its exports .
nearly the entire village fished for a living .
many tourists came to see the shore that is
riddled with abandoned boats .
the town also had boat models as attractions .
to start a vacation , we took a partner picture .
i also snapped a photo of our hotel from the street .
the grass and plants around the hotel were simple and lovely .
my wife wanted to pose as a model so i let her .
that night , we shared an experience during the sunset .
mother and father posing for the picture over the wonderful ocean backdrop .
our ocean view hotel room looks out over all the beauty .
so sandy ! this beach is one of the best i 've ever been to .
the walls here are so bare but occasionally have windows that peek out .
sun set over a long day , so beautiful .
it was about time we went on our honeymoon , 5 years after the marriage .
we stayed in a very crappy hotel in the crappiest part of town , but thankfully the building across the street looked great .
the husband and i went out to the beach to destroy the sandcastles from yesterday 's competition , it was great .
later that day , i told my husband that i wanted to become an artist , so i took this amazing photo of two tiny windows .
man , this was such a great sunset that it really summed up how amazing our honeymoon was .
today [female] and mick arrived for their honeymoon .
they had a romantic villa hotel room for their stay .
behind their hotel was some unique plants .
mick and [female] spent an entire day at the beach .
they stayed at the beach and watched the sunset on their first day of being married .
the start of our vacation was all sunshine and rainbows .
our hotel room was one of the best at the resort .
the wildlife thrived as exotic pieces of shrubbery to me .
susanne got a bit dramatic toward the end of the vacation .
our final day consisted of watched the sunset .
there are so many amazing sights that can be seen under water .
here 's some coral that i came across .
i was amazed when i saw this .
this is one cool turtle that i got to swim with .
i stayed away from this shark and focused on being safe and the items i saw today .
the fish flowed very steadily in water .
the man with the snorkel passed by quickly .
the coral hid some fish but did not hide others .
on the beach , we relaxed and talked about life .
the sun was setting over the ocean and we left .
the diver was ready to swim underwater .
the coral was bright pink .
the free flowing coral danced aimlessly in the water .
the sea turtle dived deep under water .
the shark was looking for food .
i got to snorkel on vacation last summer .
the corals were beautiful .
i saw a real anemone !
a sea turtle swam right in front of me .
i saw a shark , but my guide told me that the sharks in this area were very docile and non-threatening .
it was my first time scuba diving .
the instructor was very helpful .
the fish and coral were beautiful .
after scuba diving , i relaxed on the beach .
i watched the sun go down .
the damage to the hotel was unbelievable .
in the lobby , furniture was thrown all over the place .
outside , buildings had toppled .
the barrier fell and flooded the village .
trash littered the beach .
a couple and their parents went on a family vacation
they visited seaside , location .
the young couple had a nice time on the beach together .
the weather and scenery were beautiful .
they even visited a historically giant oak tree .
this is all that remains of my village .
sometimes i forget for all our prowess we are just human .
powerless against the rage of the earth .
if she wills it , with a simple touch we lose everything .
its both humbling and terrifying .
the house was filled with destroyed objects .
people wanted to renovate this building .
the flood damaged few areas of the land .
this is the origin of the flood .
lastly , debris covered the ground .
there was major flooding in my area .
houses were overrun .
some structures were unrecognizable .
some buildings survived but there is nothing around to stay for anymore .
i do n't recognize my home .
dover looks cool from the air .
the white cliffs are amazing .
much better than this field .
and much better than that field .
i hope we do n't crash !
looking at the land from high up in a plane was really neat .
once back on the ground we checked out the other planes .
some had a retro feel to them .
i jokingly asked the pilot of the yellow plane to take me for a ride .
surprisingly , he agreed and we took off , high over the ground !
the view from the plane was from our dreams !
we got to fly in this amazing plane !
we saw many amazing planes during our vacation .
here is one plane in action about to take off !
we enjoyed our trip immensely !
there was so much to see outside the window of the airplane .
we flew by so many islands .
there were endless farmlands it seemed .
they went on for miles .
after a few hours we finally arrived at our destination .
each year they have a wonderful air show along the beautiful coastline , far from the city .
pilots bring their planes from all over for people to see . some are relatively new .
and , some are much older and it 's interesting to learn the craft 's history .
this year one of the pilots offered to take us on a short trip over the countryside .
seeing the sights from a small plane is a much more exciting experience than in a large , higher flying , jet .
about to have fun at the beach , all smiles for the camera .
looking for seashells with her friend .
running trying to not touch the waves .
doing a hand stand in the sand
then attempting a cartwheel in the sand .
here 's my girlfriend [female] on our trip down to the ocean .
she took off her shoes and traipsed along the beach .
she also decided to show off her acrobatic skills by walking on her hands !
her sister [female] was with us and here they are at the water 's edge .
[female] got tired later on and sat down to enjoy the scenery as she rested .
we spent the entire afternoon yesterday at the beach .
i collected so many sea shells .
it was so much fun to run on the beach .
i also took the time to practice some of my gymnastic moves .
i hope we go back again soon !
today i went to the beach with my girlfriend .
we collected seashells .
we also ran in the surf .
she was excited to do handstands
and cartwheels .
the woman was so excited to spend a day at the beach .
she and her friend investigated the waves before deciding to stay mostly dry .
she did , however , enjoy running along the shore and getting her feet wet .
she was so excited that it made her want to do a handstand .
since the handstand went well , she decided to try a cartwheel also .
the vacation was fun but tiring .
the town had many interesting spots to visit .
this was a popular lodging area .
the children relaxed and let the adults do the driving .
the beach was an anticipated spot .
the family decided satuday was a good day for a road trip . the two sons decided it was a good time for a nap .
they set out on their journey , headed in the direction of the beach .
the appearance of palm trees was a sign the beach was just getting close .
it was a long trip , but the beach started coming into view .
by now , the boys were awake and enjoying the sunset on the beach .
[male] and [male] slept the entire drive to the beach .
the slept through the stop at their favorite shopping outlet .
they slept right through a stop for dinner .
when they woke up , their dad was driving just outside city limits towards the beach .
by the time they arrived it was evening , and the beach was almost vacant ; but they knew the next day would prove fun .
a family was driving to location location , their sons were asleep in the back seat .
when they entered the city , they saw a bunch of signs welcoming them to town .
they found their hotel on the side of the road .
a large billboard was in the air letting them know the name of the hotel .
the view from their hotel was a beach and palm trees .
the boys were a bit tired from the long day out and decided to take a nap .
they were still going to the beach so they needed to rest up .
a few hours later they had finally arrived to their destination .
the beach was very calm it was a very tropical scene .
the sunset was the most beautiful part of the day .
there were a lot of people on hand for the marathon .
a few of the attendees were extra pumped up , exercising .
a group of the people there attended in costume .
there were many people looking on .
all participants of the event received certificates .
last weekend we went for a vacation .
we stayed in a small hotel on an island mostly inhabited by natives .
we saw many interesting things while we were there .
our room had a bed that was so low to the floor .
at night we had a lot of fun at the local gatherings .
every winter , a large group of individuals meet at the beach for an athletics challenge .
the challenge involves everything from doing pushups in the sand , to swimming laps out into the water .
some people go `` all out '' and dress up in costumes and silly outfits .
others show up to provide support and encouragement .
much fun is to be had by all , and those who finish are rewarded with fun items like certificates .
it was a very crowded day at the beach for being so cloudy .
[male] always likes to show off when he is n't wearing a shirt .
halloween at the beach was a big hit .
you are never too young to enjoy a holiday .
the halloween fundraiser was a big success .
although the water was frigid many swimmers went in with great courage .
a great way to get the blood pumping and warm up the body is exercising .
these girls chose to express themselves with colorful costumes .
a young onlooker is fascinated with the loud noises up ahead .
holding up signs of victory , these women feel accomplished .
our hotel was very unique and we were excited for a week on the beach .
you could see the city skyline in the distance from where we were staying .
many people set up with instruments on the beach to make some extra money .
there was even a miniature carnival featuring rides for the kids .
back inside the hotel we enjoyed all the luxurious amenities that came with our package .
the tree was cool .
but so was the building .
but i liked the plate the best .
this one in particular .
i wish there were some food on it !
this is the resort i 'm staying at on my honeymoon . i have a beautiful reception planned .
just look at my friends and family enjoying this wonderful sunset .
yes , we even got catered to while we relaxed by the ocean .
these are some local rift-rafts we had to throw out . they were ruining the vibe .
this bed may not look comfy because it 's on the floor . but i swear that thing is gold . i never slept so good .
in our village there are is amazing and beautiful architecture .
since it is always warm we get to enjoy lots of time relaxing on the beach .
now that we know how to cook on the beach we never have to leave !
it 's an even better day when the carnival comes to the beach .
after a long day it is nice to retire to a nice cozy , comfy , space .
taking a tour of the city is so much fun .
the beach is so beautiful when the sun is setting
the water helps you to relax especially when with friends
you can always find something fun to do at the each
this room is a little different than i am used to but alway up to new things
the trip provided a lot of outdoor entertainment .
the beach was warm and sandy .
the roads were easy to travel on .
night clubs provided live entertainment .
during the day , there were parks and trails to explore .
during our sightseeing trip , [male] climbed up the sand dunes .
nearby , [male] fished off the rocky ledges as the waves crashed nearby .
here we are leaving the beautiful ocean on our way to the pub .
we had some wonderful lager later on .
we finished the night by listening to a great band play .
i think i 'm going to travel the world in one day , starting with this mound of dirt .
here i am already at the beach , just three hours later .
it 's starting to get dark , i need to pull over for a drink .
found this sweet bar to have a drink at . they got this awesome live band .
had a little of a long night and never made it out of the bar . i knew i should n't of had a pit stop !
the family went to the beach for a vacation .
the son played on the rocks on the shore .
they drove in a rental car along the water .
they stopped for some beer during their ride .
at the end of the night , they stopped to watch a local band play .
we made the best of summer vacation and did a lot of things . here i am climbing to the top of a big rock .
we also spent a lot of time at the beach .
here is one of the coastal roads we passed .
of course , partying was part of the vacation too . here is a concert i enjoyed .
we also had a lot of time to relax .
the lady went to visit her parents at their home up north for the first time in years .
living in the south for the past ten years she had become accustomed to warmer weather and made sure to bundle up for spending time outside .
her brother and dad were happy to see her .
her husband was more excited to be there than she was as he had never seen snow before .
back at the house they all sat down for a warm meal .
i walked the dog .
we were near the house .
i had my hood on .
it started to get dark .
so i turned on the lights inside .
a house is for sale in the middle of the woods .
she seems to like it very much so she calls her husband to come look at it also .
the husband arrives with his mom and they both seem to enjoy the house .
they just completed the closing of the house purchase
and throw a house warming party .
my wife and i went to her family cottage last winter .
she looked beautiful and cold .
her two brothers were there .
and her parents were there too .
we all had a great family dinner that night .
going home for the holidays is an important tradition .
for this woman , it could also be a little bit stressful .
still , seeing her brother and father made her feel better .
the woman 's husband was happy to be there as well , which helped .
in the end , the whole family had a nice dinner together .
the family decides to spend the day at the beach .
dad tries to tell them that sledding on the sand is just like sledding on snow .
the boy decides to go and play with rocks .
mom tells him to stop throwing things in case he accidentally hits someone .
at the end of the day it 's nice to cool off and soak your feet in the surf .
the whole family was snow sledding .
it was n't the fastest sport but they had fun .
they even all went together .
everyone had a great time playing on the beach .
they had a great time talking the walk home .
[male] , [female] and their mother loved coming to the beach ; sand sledding was their favorite activity , with mom leading the way .
then it was [male] 's turn ; he was the youngest , and always got first dibs of the children .
[male] loved the beach ; he loved to collect shells and rocks to put in a jar at home .
and play time with mommy always resulted in tickle torture !
the best part of all was that there were so many other children for him to play with !
we had an awesome time at the beach this weekend !
we did n't need water-just each other !
the baby boy was in his own world of fun all day .
the only time he sat still was when i reeled him in for a quick tickle attack !
these are the days they 'll always remember .
the day at the beach started with some sand surfing .
after watching the fun the little boy joined in .
however , he quickly went in search of treasures on the sand .
until the tickle monster caught him and he laughed with absolute joy .
as the day turned to eve the little boys walked down to say goodbye to waves for today .
i saw a bird .
it was flying .
so i took it 's picture .
but not only four times .
i actually took it 5 times !
the birds fly happily along the water and sand .
some fly closer to the ground .
others fly high in the sky .
the city lies just a few miles away .
for some , that is there destination .
the bird is gliding through the clouds .
the bird is now gliding through the cloudless sky .
the bird is continuing to glide through the cloudless sky .
as the bird continues flying , it is getting darker and darker .
the bird seems to be on the hunt for food .
flight patterns of sea-bound birds carry influence over their efficiency .
for example , maintaining balance on high winds requires a flexibility and grace not often associated with birds .
equally , hunting for fish in the sea requires the ability to fight gusts in order to focus on fish in the water .
arching the wings , as seen in this picture , increases dynamics and speed .
while cupping the wings provides the opportunity for height .
watching graceful bird flying always makes me want to fly
sometimes i pretend i am air traffic control navigating their flight
this is mission control you are clear to keep heading east
you are clear to come in for a landing
watching birds can make the imagintion soar
the boys had a really fun day . first they took turns pitching balls .
then they practiced their karate kicks on a kicking machine .
to end the day , they put on warm clothes and went to the beach where they built a little fire .
they walked down towards the water as the sun went down .
finally they gathered with others to watch as the day ended in beauty .
i was so mad i kicked something .
this guy was mad too .
we all decided to kick it .
and because of our anger , we started a fire .
it burned like the rage burns in my soul .
the boy is practicing his pitching .
he is also practicing kicking .
after practice he goes camping on the beach with his friends .
the boy runs to the beach to watch the sun set .
his friends join him .
my wife and i had an exciting day , we started it off by playing indoor baseball .
then we played kickboxing .
after the gym my wife and i had a bonfire on the beach .
she wanted to take a walk into the ocean .
together with our feet in the ocean we watched the sun set .
measuring how hard and how fast he throws .
measuring how hard he kicks .
then went to the beach to go camping , build a camp fire .
and watch the sunset .
family watching the sunset together .
we took our boat to the sandbar island , one of the coolest places to go .
there were already a bunch of people there wandering around but that was okay as there was plenty of room for everyone .
we all enjoyed ourselves , some swimming , some kayaking , some laying on the sand .
on the island there was a really cool pavilion on top of a hill that we trekked up to .
for our reward we saw an awesome lizard up there !
our trip started off to a scary start by watching a large crocodile run by .
we found a some what secluded beach to picnic and swim .
i took a picture of some bird which i learned later was an pelican .
we saw a man kayaking and we rented a few boats to do the same .
we finished the day by climbing a watch tower to see the view .
on this weekend we decided to have some fun on the water
the beach was beautiful
there were a lot of people out on this summer afternoon
the gazebo atop of the rocky hill was where we had park lunch
oh my god we were freaked out when this huge lizard scurried out from the under brush .
the beach was not crowded today but there were 2 boats on shore .
i hiked up a hill to get a better picture of the sandbar .
i also got a great picture of a kayaker .
the gazebo on top of the hill offered a great vantage point .
i met this lizard on the way back to the beach .
we encountered this creature seeking for shade very early in the morning . it woke us all up .
we got very lucky that day as the beach was almost empty .
the albatross is definitely the king of the seas in this area .
even later in the afternoon , the beach was scarcely populated , with just a few people in the water and a guy on his canoe .
on top the hill , the gazebo was offering a magnificent view of the bay as well as a place to rest and cool down .
i saw some power lines on my trip .
then i saw even more power lines .
electrical transmission must be important here .
how did i know that ?
because the the power lines are everywhere !
the beach is empty with no one to be found .
many rocks line the beach .
the beach contains a lot of algae .
the road is completely empty .
the palm trees sway in the wind .
yesterday we went out on a road trip and stopped in a small town .
there was a huge dirt pit in the middle of town .
there was nobody out and about on the streets .
the entire place felt very empty .
we decided to move on .
we went to visit a beautiful beach early in the morning .
we watched the waves crash against the shore .
the temperature was fair and the sight of the ocean was magnificent .
after viewing the ocean , we drove down the street to a new location .
while driving , we had a nice side view of the ocean and of a few palm trees blowing in the breeze .
i visited the beach just to observe the beauty of this closeby natural beauty .
the waves bounced against rocks and made a big splash .
here the waves are being a little bit calmer , but one more is coming in the distance !
after awhile i went to my car and sat in it in the parking lot . i snapped a picture as well while i ate my lunch .
after that i went back to the beach to bid it farewell . till we meet again , my friend .
i love taking pictures of pollution .
i try to capture it as best i can .
i also like pictures of nothing .
see , here 's another shot of nothing .
but this one is by far the best !
going on an evening walk .
looking at several birds walking in the beach .
watching the beautiful sunset .
loving the clouds and the color of the sky .
walking back home looking at a full moon .
i took a trip to the ocean and saw this interesting building
i proceed up the beach and its pretty empty .
walking the trail .
still walking the trail
finally i reach the city .
seems like a long way back to our car
but the scenery is so beautiful
not sure we are ready to leave
do you love watching sunsets ?
the memories of the beach play in my head on the way home
i took a stroll along the shore one day , just me and my camera .
oh wait , i am not alone . there is a group of birds there .
as the sun set i got some awesome pictures .
it is these fleeting moments of the day that are the most brilliant .
as i walked home i snapped a picture too . this was just a few steps from the beach .
the two couples decide to take a walk along the sea shore .
they see lots of waves and the boyfriends threaten to throw the girls in .
they scream and run when they see the waves crashing on the shore .
they stop to explore the starfish and other sea creatures .
then they watch a guy throw a stick for his dog . they decide that they love the beach .
the village lies next to the beach .
it is a great place to spend time with pets .
the waves hit the shores with passion .
the evening sky is just as fabulous .
the view is always spectacular .
the family together after church , such a beautiful day it was
the waves were rough although still beautiful
the magnificence of the waves crashing against the rocks , such beauty !
rusted beauty , these gears were the remnants of an old contraption
walked fluffy on the shore she had such wonderful day
this was our honeymoon vacation . there were are holding hands in the distance .
the waves were pretty fierce this time and they were fun to observe .
here is a wave splashing on a structure .
i saw these gears and thought they would look great in my album so i snapped a picture
oh , did i mention my dog came along ? yes , i can not live without him !
it 's always nice to spend a day at the beach with friends .
sometimes , though , the waves come crashing in , and it 's safer to watch from a distance .
the waves can get really big and beautiful .
after the waves subside , starfish can be found all over the beach .
then it 's safe to go back and take a nice walk along the shore again .
i saw some debris .
then i saw some gravel .
i also found some small rocks .
but then i found bigger rocks .
then came the boulders ! ! ! !
newly restored stairs to the beach were opened today .
beach goers can now easily get to and from the beach .
before the stairs were restored people had to carefully walk down a series of dangerous rocks .
now more people can enjoy the beach .
last year 25 people suffered injuries ranging from cuts to broken legs , now that wo n't happen anymore .
there were so many interesting things for nido to film at the beach .
nothing escaped his curiosity , including the pebbles mixed into the sand .
he loved the way light fell onto the rocks , casting shadows at so many angles .
his own shadow falling upon the large boulders had become a subject of great interest .
even the boulders leading to the sky where bushes took over held a sense of solidarity .
my friend and i went to the beach today , there were a lot of staircases to walk down .
the second staircase was even larger then the first .
because it is so bright outside , i was able to see my shadow .
the beach was quite crowded today .
so we turned around and had to walk the staircases all over again .
i looked at the stairs between me and the days adventure .
after quickly glancing back to where i had been i struck off to find the sights of the day .
i could n't resist taking a picture of the rock formations .
in the distance , i watched all of the happy people race across the beach and soak up the warming rays of the sun .
i was quickly tired out from an exciting day in the sun and headed back to the stairs hoping i would find the energy to return to my car .
it was a great day for kite flying .
the young child brought his favorite to the beach .
the two enjoyed their day together .
his parent stood behind and him and gave him freedom .
the waves came in gently .
we went to the beach this afternoon .
my daughter and i had a blast walking on the sand during sunset .
i surprised her by bringing a kite !
she was so excited watching it .
it was colorful and looked like a large parrot .
a kite soaring flawlessly through the blue skies .
she tries to fly the kite herself .
a daughter watches her father fly the kite down the beach
a father and daughter spend time together flying a kite
they both finish the day off watching the waves crash on the coast
[female] laughed as she watched her beautiful kite fly soar swiftly up into the clear blue sky .
[female] 's dad took pictures because it was [female] 's birthday and he was so proud of her being such a great kite flier . they had the whole beach to themselves .
[female] ran after her father as he headed for a good place to eat their picnic lunch .
[female] 's dad let her fly the kite one more time before lunch and it climbed so high [female] thought it would fly away into the heavens .
then [female] and her dad sat on the beach and ate the turkey sandwiches her mom had made . they talked about how much fun the day had been . but now it was time to go home and eat some birthday cake !
every year we go to the beach to enjoy a family vacation .
our daughter loves the clean air that is found on the coast .
every year she is amazed when we get our kite into the air .
sometimes she tries to mimic the kite as it flies away in all directions .
that kite flying in the air is a sight that never gets old .
wow was it snowy !
there was so much snow on the lake .
it was deep enough to see foot prints .
but then the sun came out .
so i stood in the middle of the road !
on our way going on a hike in the forest .
the roads are really empty this morning .
it is really cold out .
made long food prints in the snow .
and we spotted a family of deer in the forrest .
on the way up to visit the beautiful snowy scenery !
on the straight and narrow ! ( and a little icy ... )
beauty in the background and foreground .
walking a serene but lonely path .
it 's the simple things in nature that are so beautiful !
we arrived at the large frozen lake after quite a long drive .
it was beautiful and serene with a light dusting of snow .
we could tell by our footprints in the snow that no one had been there since it had fallen .
the lake was surrounded by dense woods waiting out the cold winter .
after a lovely day , we hit the road for the long drive home .
we set off in the cold weather .
the woods were beautiful and the roads empty .
at the campsite i took a picture of my wife .
we walked a bit through the virgin snow .
the woods were cold and silent as the sun set on our day .
this tropical resort is the perfect place for the dad to take his two daughters on vacation .
they decide to wander down to the beach from their bungalow .
dad promises to take them boating once the boats come back to port .
until then they decide to walk along the beach .
the daughters try to convince dad to take a kayak . he laughs and tells them no .
[male] and [female] returned from their boating adventure hot , tired and ready for a relaxing meal .
but as they walked towards their hotel , they heard an unusual noise .
they stopped a person along the beach to ask ; `` oh , that 's just winky the dolphin - he wants treats ! ''
sure enough , along the boat dock was a friendly dolphin calling out for someone to give him a treat .
they went back to their room , promising winky to return with leftovers from their meal .
the view from our hotel room was amazing .
we were right on the beach as well .
we were a short walk from a marina
and the lagoon
which was tranquil
the beach resort is now officially open , it features a large garden inside of the hotel entrance .
the hotel has it 's own private beach .
and a private cove with docks for boats .
there is a long walkway for children to play on .
and kayaks are available for recreation use .
ca n't believe we made it to the beach before the rush
beauty is unbeliveable at the beach
we are able to looks around or just lay out if we like
the pier will be filled with people soon
even the inside of the building has beautiful foliage
hi , we 're the howells . we like to take vacations on our boat .
this is our lovely little boat named the minnow . that 's where we cast off .
it was a beautiful morning . we were below stowing away gear when suddenly we heard loud sirens !
we were almost run over by this huge cruise ship ! luckily the minnow quickly turned away and the crises was averted .
soon we 'll be at our cozy island cabin tucked back in the woods for a peaceful weekend enjoying nature .
going fishing with the family .
about to unwrap the main sail .
everything is ready , we are ready to sail at sea .
spotting an island for a quick luck break .
in the middle of the afternoon we saw a cruise ship .
me and my dad went for a ride on his boat today .
he has a large boat .
we sailed it around the harbor .
a huge cruise ship passed by us .
it was very peaceful out on the water .
we love boomerangs so we just had to get our picture her .
this was our tour boat for the day .
on the tour we encountered another couple from the cruise on their own tour .
it looks like we missed our cruise ship but it was actually re-docking .
here we are leaving the little island .
time to go sailing
setting up the mast can be tricky
wow look how high the sail goes
leaving portside always makes me giddy
next stop total fun in the sun
the park is on the shore .
there is a quiet beach there .
you can get there by boat .
the beach is a quiet place .
the location location are a great place to see .
the wildlife refuges were all we looked forward to during the trip .
next to the entrance , a bulletin board mentioned all of the events and important information .
there were signs along the path that told us what creature we might find near .
mom and [male] used the time to talk about what they could do to help out .
then we walked down to the ocean to observe the scenery .
these were some shots i grabbed at the beach the other week .
the walk was so beautiful . we found lots of seashells .
this boat was roaring by . it looked fun to drive .
my mom and aunt were looked for shells . they had fun .
this was the site . i ca n't wait to get back .
here on vacation in location . we 're at the nature center .
such blue seas off the coast . gon na take my boat out today .
here i am speeding down the beach . i love the ocean here i could stay here forever .
here are some the locals , they walk this beach daily .
a sign i came across in the beach . i wonder if i 'll find any wild animals out here .
this sign was at the beginning of the trail .
looking down towards our little cabin .
there goes [male] in the boat !
aunt meg and aunt [female] on the beach .
the sign where we stopped for our picnic .
[male] and [female] threw a beach themed new year 's party at their bar .
[male] brought his own swim trunks and raft to the party .
a trio of bar regulars showed up in sailor outfits .
[male] and his wife [female] won the costume contest , complete with a lei-wearing dog !
many drinks , food , and good times were had by all .

we had good food and good drinks .
we set up for the new years party .

we had some drinks and put on music .
once everyone was there we started the celebration .
we sat around partying and conversing till midnight .
there was a new years party at the local bar today .
people were all dressed up .
there were some people that were dressed up as sailors .
there were also some people that dressed up as tourists .
overall , everyone had a great time .
we grabbed our spot on the beach to watch the annual fireworks display .
the sun began to set over the city .
we watch with anticipation as the men light the first one .
then we oohhh and ahhhh as it bursts it 's color across the sky
too soon it was over . we will definitely be back again .
the fireworks show had started and we were ready for the action .
the beach was were we decided to watch the fireworks .
here the two of us are before the fireworks show .
the fireworks were amazing showing multiple different colors .
the skyline of the city from our view on the beach .
my friend and i are just waiting on fireworks show to start .
the night is beautiful with the city lights in the background .
the fireworks show has finally started .
the fireworks show is great . it usually last about 20 minutes .
the ending is the best of it all . so many going off one right behind the other .
though the photo is blurry , we were happy to get out tonight .
with the skyline in view , we started to wait for the fireworks .
and this is one the first firework started to go off .
here they are bursting in the sky . very colorful and well done .
the booms from these bright white fireworks made our chests rumble .
we went to the beach to wait for the fireworks .
we saw the city skyline in the distance .
then the fireworks finally began when it got dark .
they were so magical .
at the end i was sad they were over .
it 's the beach !
everyone was there today .
it was so much fun .
the water was chilly .
but that did n't stop us .
there were so many people at the swimming event !
we all stood on the shore waiting for the race to begin .
some competitors wore costumes !
the water was so cold !
i had a great time , but was ready to go home .
i went to the beach today with some of my friends .
we checked out some guys .
and we met this sweet lady .
some random woman then started yelling at us .
my friends and i ran away laughing .
this year we decided to watch as individuals were going to swim in ice cold lake location .
this child looks so frightened , i hope his parents do not allow him to participate .
my boyfriend and his best friend were going to take the plunge .
this group of individuals just wet their feet , their bodies could not take it .
my boyfriend decided against taking the plunge , but he watched his friend jump in .
swimsuits have a great range of styles .
speedo 's .
ultra conservative .
large ones .
and if you do n't have one , just wear your shorts .
our vacation at the beach was great !
we had an amazing view from our room .
the beds were really comfortable and nice .
the bathroom was clean and even had a double sink .
there also was plenty of room to sit and hang out with friends .
[male] was on vacation at this wonderful beach .
he headed into his room and put his things away .
he looking around the room and he liked what he seen .
[male] was finishing unpacking all of his stuff .
it was now time to head to the beach and search for some babes .
this is my hotel .
we had a great view of the island .
beds were okay .
at least there were two sinks .
not a fan of hardwood floors in the bedroom .
checked out the view of the beach and went to get ready .
i went into my room to find something to wear .
i had to think hard on this one .
i had to make sure i looked the part .
i got ready and headed out .
we stayed at a pretty fancy hotel in location this trip .
it was a high rise , right on the beach .
the beds were extra-long !
the bathroom was so fancy , with two sinks !
the room even had a hallway !
it was a great day for surfing as my friend [male] plunged into surf .
gnarly waves were to be had .
my friend [male] hung ten like a pro .
at least for a few seconds before the big wave caught up to him .
what followed was an epic wipe out .
the waves were gnarly dude
my bro tackled them like nothing
all the fly honeys wanted him
nothing better than hot girls and good waves
this is were fear goes to die
the waves on that beautiful day were huge !
i caught one hard and perfect .
i was riding it out with ease .
i caught the end of the funnel .
i finished with a dive right over the top of the wave .
this is a great day for surfing with massive waves .
a man that is surfing catches the wave and rides it .
as the wave starts to drop over he rides underneath it .
the wave is too massive and out of control .
the man loses his footing with all the water pouring on him he falls off .
we went to the beach today , walking along the beach .
we saw a surfer out in the waves !
when he walked by , we said hi .
we walked into the water to get a closer look at him .
we saw another surfer riding a wave !
i stayed outside recently at our lake house to watch the sunset .
the sunset was relaxing and peaceful .
i really enjoyed watching the shadows change as the sun went down .
i watched until you could barely see a spec of light on the horizon .
i think i am going to watch the sunset more often from now on .
[male] and i were sad that it was last night of vacation . we decided to watch the sun rise .
it is so beautiful to watch the sun to rise while on the beach .
we relaxed for a bit and watched it rise . we decided to make today a good day .
once the sun rose , we decided to go on the boat tour we had been wanting to go on .
i had a special surprise for [male] . i was going to show him the dress i was going to wear to the wedding . he loved it !
we sat in and prepared to watch the sunset .
it was amazing how fast it happened .
i loved the colors it made in the sky .
as it disappeared , i did n't want to see it go .
right before it was gone , the halo it left was beautiful .
it is sunset at this lake and the sun is a perfect orange circle .
it is amazing how the sun stretches over the water and the sky colors change .
the sky changes from blue to pink to orange .
as the sun dips below the trees the skies colors change and it gets darker .
the sun was lighting up the water and now the water is dark and looks cold .
with a mouth that could n't scream the mayfly tried to scream but settled for flying in erratic circles .
the sun was setting .
its day was up .
every circle the mayfly made was more difficult than the last . the sun seemed to sink farther behind the horizon each time the mayfly checked .
as the mayfly began dropping to the ground it looked to the sun one more time and saw in its place a beautiful orange sky . as the mayfly rested fully onto a leaf , stilled its wings , and closed its eyes it realized how lucky it was to have seen the sunset that so many other mayflys would never get to see .
the lake looked amazing .
but so did the sun .
it was such a wonderful event to witness .
just look at the contrasts .
i even had to take a wide angle shot !
my annual trip to the lake is a journey that i make on my own .
i used to go with my grandpa and one of his favorite things to do would be to watch the sunset .
grandpa is n't here anymore so i make the trek alone and i am astounded by the colors every time .
each year i make a quiet pact with myself to always remember the good times with my grandpa .
no matter where i am sunsets remind me of grandpa , but i always feel a special connection when i make my journey to the lake .
our beautiful retirement vacation to location
the lake was frozen magnificence and you can even see the aura which was there the whole trip
sunset over the lake was breathtaking
another angle of seemingly the end of the earth
a picture of the lake from the shore
after a long day of fishing , we setup camp by the lake .
my dad fried the fish while i walked along the shore and watched the sunset .
i was awed by the beautiful colors and even saw some pink and lilac .
soon the sky color changed to a deep blue and orange and i found peace with nature .
i returned to the campsite and was able to capture one more spectacular view of the sunset .
the water is very calm
the outline of the trees mirror in the water
the sun is setting and makes the area cozy
love the warm glow of the red orange and blue
the scene looks like a painting
the pool hosted its first swim meet last weekend .
swimmers from around the county competed against each other at the new outdoor facility .
swimmers competed in several events .
records were set in free style and breaststroke
over 400 swimmers competed and 9 new records were set .
at the swimming race my friend was trying to get another first place finish .
a competitor to my friend had an excellent butterfly swim .
another competitor dipped her head in the water during a breast stroke .
the backstroke is where my friend struggled the most .
the winner of the competition swam much faster than the rest of the competitors .
first he dove in the water with excitement .
he spent some time doing the back stroke .
he fought hard to make is to the other side .
he took long strides and came up for air .
he rushed to the end with taking deep breathes .
my swim team had a competition last week .
i raced in the 100 butterfly .
and my friend won her breaststroke race .
i attempted the backstroke , but i 'm not very good at it .
and my sister won her freestyle race .
we made it in time to see an excellent swim meet .
here is the winner of the backstroke just before the finish of the race .
the free style started with butterfly .
most of the swimmers chose to do the breast stroke back to the starting gate .
here is the winner finishing the race with the butterfly stroke again .
the little girl went to the beach .
her parents watched her while she was there .
her brother gave her a piggy back ride .
afterwards , they saw some grassy beach .
and found their dog over by a beach house .
a family decided to go on vacation .
they brought their two children .
of course the family dog came with , too .
on the trip , the dog ran away into a field of tall grass .
at the end of the day , they found their dog !
the family took a vacation along the coast on a windy , cold weekend . it was so windy that the girl almost lost her hat .
the mother and father took a break to enjoy the ocean view .
later in the day , the girl played piggy-back with her brother .
then the weather became even windier and the ocean churned .
despite the weather , the vacation was a success and even the dog enjoyed it .
the family went to the beach yesterday .
the parents watched as the children played in the sand .
the older brother gave his little sister a piggy back ride .
the ocean was too cold to go swimming .
the family dog had a good time on the beach too .
a day at the beach under overcast skies .
this couple posed on the empty beach .
a father and his daughter played and bundled up against the cold .
the ocean roared at a distance under darkening clouds .
near the cottage , a puppy kept watch over the beachgoers .
this year we decided to explore the country side on horseback .
there are so many different sights to see like boats in the bay .
it is also nice to stop and enjoy the river .
the horses decide to stop for a drink .
then it is back to town to rest and refresh ourselves .
the trip started with a ferry ride on the river .
then mom , dad , grandma and the kids all went horse back riding on the beach in the afternoon .
after riding horses we stopped at a local cafe for coffee overlooking the beach .
later in the day we went to town to visit all the scenic tourist shops and a famous pub in a pink building .
at the end of the day i wanted to take a picture of the famous bridge across the town 's river .
my friends and i got to the river around 6pm . we were ready to go .
a group of horses were staged there , ready for us to ride . we climbed on and rode into the ocean .
after a couple miles , we came upon a large , old building near the shore . we rode the horses up and stepped down .
after lunch at the old building , we strode through the rest of town , which had a shopping district with a parking lot .
we embarked again , on the horses , leaving the city behind .
we took our annual trip to the beach .
that is the boat that we use to get across the ocean .
there is also a bridge we can drive across
further up the river we go fishing .
this is our house we are staying at .
there was so much to do at the cape today . here is the view from the car .
the kids all went horse back riding at the water 's edge .
i stayed dry to take some pictures of the local architecture .
here is where we wound up at the end of the day .
i went around to the front to get another picture of the colorful homes in the area .
[male] decided to take his camera for a trek of a hill overlooking the beach .
the people on the beach were the size of ants , it seemed .
the views were breathtaking .
there were however , some lurking dangers .
all in all , it was an enjoyable adventure for [male] .
today is the perfect day for us to take a walk along the sea shore .
we like to follow the trail around the edge of the point .
we look at sea creatures on the rocks .
and we make sure to avoid the snake .
the old dinghy on the rock indicates that we are close to home again .
we had been hiking for hours now and the beach was finally in sight .
we could see it far below . we had to figure out a way to get down from here .
it was still quite far away .
we almost had a dangerous encounter with a poisonous snake while we were trying to figure it out .
after the encounter with the snake we decided to give up .
we hit the dirt road that led to the beach .
the beach was empty and the water was pristine .
we discovered this abandoned cove .
unfortunately we also discovered this snake .
we climbed the hills behind the beach to get a view of the shore extending as far as the eyes could see .
it was a long ride from town around the mountain near the ocean shore .
as i biked along the rode , i saw people walking along the beach .
the lagoon was a beautiful mixture of crystal clear water and white sand beach .
as i was taking photos , i noticed i had a visitor in this snake . it startled me and i took off quickly .
as i returned to the town , i was able to capture another great view of this magnificent coastline .
the desert organization organization , arts and crafts exposition kicked off sunday .
there were handcrafted pots among the wares on display .
colored sand also was a big hit .
the expo included demonstrations of newfangled gadgets .
afterward , there was a tour of the nearby canyons .
we went to a museum this weekend to to look at paintings .
after the museum he went to a fair to buy gifts .
i bought some colored sand in a bottle to take home .
later we rented a boat to go to an island that had prehistoric paintings .
we climbed the cliffs on the island to explore the surroundings .
vacations always create special memories .
one gets to experience the way of other cultures
there are treats to buy around every corner .
lakes are always family fun .
it is always great to also go hiking through the ranges .
we were incredibly lost last week . the only thing we could see for miles was a large windmill .
finally we came across some civilization . there was an outdoor market that had some unique merchandise .
there were tons of products for sale .
i 'm not quite sure what this is for .
after browsing for a while we had to continue our journey .
my husband an i went on our honeymoon in location last month .
there were all sorts of markets selling hand painted pottery .
i purchased some jars of colored sand .
outside our hotel was a big calm sea to swim in .
and there were areas to hike in too .
our trip to location was amazing . here 's an up close photo of a kangaroo .
and we came upon a koala .
we trekked on the australian desert .
and came to a beach with seals !
the beach was really , really amazing .
[male] went on a trip to see wildlife . it involved long hikes but it was worth it .
he saw seals frolicking on the shore near the surf .
he also saw some rare lizards while passing the thick brush .
the views were absolutely breathtaking .
his favorite thing to see was the field full of kangaroos hopping around . it was a very memorable trip .
im alone here on this island .
nothing but me and the critters .
seals and lizards as far as the eye can see .
the loneliness is crushing but the sites are beautiful .
least i can eat well tonight .
this is a very unique place that not many people know about . researchers come here to learn about wildlife .
the seals are comfortable enough to sit on the beach and sun bathe and play .
there are other creatures that come onto the island and make it their home .
the rocks surrounding the island are huge but a beautiful site .
the wildlife are extreme here . there are even kangaroos .
we walked up the hill on the beach .
we spotted seals near the shore .
there was a lizard in it 's habitat .
the waters were very calm .
lastly , we spotted a herd of kangaroos .
we went to the beach during winter .
it was a clear day .
my dad brought a kite to fly .
my little brother tried blowing bubbles .
i think it was too cold for the bubbles to work well .
a walk on the beach is always relaxing .
the water looks a bit cold though .
yep , it 's cold out . needed my winter coat to fly the kite .
brr ! my hands are freezing . can we go home now ?
yay back home with my sweet son .
a woman went on a beach vacation with her friend and her son . the sand was pristine .
the water , although cold , was calm that day .
the two women flew a kite .
the boy preferred to blow bubbles .
he ended up using the whole bottle .
we went out to the beach one day .
the waves where calm and the day was peaceful .
it was cold but we brought the kites to fly .
we got the kid a snack to eat while there .
he was n't to excited but it got better . it was still a fun day .
the beach had many footsteps
from the people looking at the calm water .
they then got bubbles
to blow along the beach
with others watching .
there was water .
so much water .
it was a river .
and a bridge .
with guys on a rock .
everyone gathered by the waterfront for the parade .
there were many who walked down the street that day .
the bagpipe players were everyone 's favorite .
the guys even decorated their truck .
last but not least , the kids made their way down the street .
we headed out to the road to see the parade .
then it seemed that everyone else felt the same .
bagpipe players came first leading the parades music .
vehicles came by carrying various characters .
in the back where the ones marching for causes and such . a standard parade .
the water was calm
before the waves started coming .
the bridges were not affected
and remained standing .
the people wanted to go into the water .
went out to town today and the river was really flowing .
the parade started just on time and the streets were filled with people .
love the sounds of the music playing from the bag pipes .
everyone joined in and decorated their trucks and themselves .
the last of it and people are already heading home . what a wonderful day we had .

she was exhausted when she returned from her adventure .
the photographer arrived on the scene to a beautiful lily .
he moved down toward the beach and saw a gorgeous red flower .
and , when he reached the beach , the animals arrived .
since , he was afraid of animals , the photographer quickly moved on and saw a gorgeous cactus ...
and , he finally , reached his final view ... a , beautiful entry point to the caverns .
the purple plant is in bloom .
there are several color flowers .
there are bright red colors in bloom .
there is a bird in the flowers .
the cat is relaxing on top of a red pillow at the end of the night .
the flowers were very pretty

and the bird thought so too
and so did the dog .
it is so peaceful out in my garden today .
the flowers are blooming and so bright .
nature at its best . seeing the different colors and shapes is always breath taking .
even the birds love my garden .
my dog lays on a pillow in the shade and takes it all in .
this couple wanted to spend some time together .
they started off their day by having coffee with some friends .

at the wedding
before the band played .
the rocks were very big near the shore .
we could see very tall grass over the water .
near the grass was a pier for many boats .
we rode one of the boats to get a closer view of the city .
after riding for a while , we arrived at choppy waters .
the pier is full of boats .
we enter the river and with other boats .
we pass the lighthouse next to the tall bridge .
a yacht passes slowly and safely under the long bridge .
we are on the beach and have been joined by another boat .
this year we took our first trip in a long time .
we visited the lake . it was so beautiful .
we got a beautiful pic of the skyline and bridge near the marina .
i wanted to ride on one of the boats , but we did n't have time .
the water was so beautiful that day . i had to get a picture !
water is important for life . the ocean provides life for many species .
lakes are home to different types of fish and plants .
this coastal city gets a lot of revenue from their fishermen .
the ferries take tourists around the bay .
without water humanity could not survive .
[male] 's family loved traveling across the world by water . they loved the ocean .
they loved sight seeing and the ocean breeze . they 'd stop and take photo 's of the beautiful view .
they 'd spend hours out of the day away . then they 'd report back to the docs .
the next day , [male] 's family boat would be back out to sea . [male] sometimes even enjoyed cruising the ocean seas all alone .
when alone , [male] would still take photos . he new his wife and kids would n't want to miss the beautiful scenery he stumbled upon on his solo journeys .
just six months ago stew and [male] decided to take a road trip with some friends .
they hate riding in the car and found it best to sleep while driving .
they took 3 days to get to their destination , it was more beautiful than they thought it might be .
they were so excited when they got there .
they had to take the obligatory bff picture .
a few friends decided to go on a road trip .
they went to see the country 's biggest fruit sculpture .
they were unamused .
but luckily one of the friends was a clown in his spare time .
the road trip was ultimately worth it as they saw the sun set at their destination .
its so easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of life .
its easy to get worn out and forget whats important .
sometimes you need time for yourself .
time to unwind with friends and family .
time to make yourself happy again .
friends came together for a trip .
the ride up the mountain was really long .
the mountain view was beautiful .
they let go of balloons to celebrate friendship .
the day has only just begun .
the men were sitting on the couch
before they fell asleep .
then they saw a lake
before they threw balls up
and took photos .
it was a beautiful summer day spent with friends .
[male] took us out on the lake in his boat .
everybody that wanted to try took a turn water skiing .
[male] spent most of his time in the water .
the best part of the day was relaxing with my friends .
it was a beautiful day to take the boat out and do some water skiing .
we were all smiles with excitement .
here is a friend ready to take his turn .
he was doing a great job ,
until he took the tumble . he was okay and we continued with our fun filled day .
a group of friends went out boating on the lake .
my friend [male] drove the boat , which belonged to his dad .
a group of us tried water-skiing behind the boat .
[male] was the best and showed us all how it was done .
other friends were content to just ride in the boat and enjoy the sun and breeze .
the family got together to spend the day at the lake .
everyone enjoyed riding the boat .
then everyone same in the water .
after that we did some water skiing .
sometimes we would fall into the water .
[male] was excited to show his friends his new boat , and try to get them up on the wake board .
his buddies had never wake boarded before , but were willing to try .
here 's [male] taking his first try , and looking a bit pensive about it .
success ! he got up first try and boarded behind the boat .
however , his first try at trying to jump the wake did not go quite as well .
i finally got to visit location location .
we walked all around .
this is the falls close up .
we walked upstream to see where people go over in a barrel .
there were many other sightseers there .
a man visited location location .
the man was able to stand very close to the edge of the falls .
at a distance , he noticed a partial rainbow forming over the crowd .
by standing on a different angle , he could see a complete rainbow over the crowd .
the man enjoyed posing in front of a rainbow himself .
i went to visit location location this summer .
i had a friend of mine take pictures of me with the falls behind me .
the falls were enormous and had an amazing amount of power .
above the falls , the waters were rough , and there was spray everywhere .
people crowded around to watch the falls in action .
[male] was excited to see location location .
he loved to watch to water fall ,
and he loved how the excited people were over this spectacular sight .
[male] also enjoyed the way the rainbow formed over the water ,
so he just had to take a picture with it .
we took a trip to location location .
it was such a nice day to visit the water fall .
we got a really good few of the water fall .
then we walked around the water to look at the scenery .
after that we came across a large crowd taking pictures .
it 's summer in del mar and these friends have rented a condo on the beach for the summer .
they are spending their days having fun in the sun .
tito belongs to [female] and likes to sit and watch everyone .
[male] and [female] are [female] 's parents and actually own the condo , so they have stopped by .

in the end , it was a wonderful vacation for all involved .
sitting in the sand with puppy was nice .
we enjoyed the weather ,
and so did he .
we sat and chatted for a bit ,
before going to the beach .
i recently was set up on a blind date , and was immediately turned off by the dog at her front door .
i played with the dog anyway because i wanted to make a good impression .
playing with the dog must have worked because she quickly grew attached to me .
i ca n't believe how lucky i am to be with a girl as attractive as her .
we are perfect together , and it may have never happened if i did n't pretend to love that mangy dog .
we traveled to location .
the light houses were so nice .
the beaches were pristine .
they had so many features , like these rocks .
the wildlife was cool too !
we woke in the morning and before we left , we appreciated this yellow flower .
i took my yellow jeep out to the desert .
i wanted to get closer to the beach so i drove through sand .
i got closer to the shore when i saw the rocks .
on my boat , i was able to see the crystal blue water .
location has a large tourism industry .
people visiting location usually spend time by the ocean .
these people are wake boarding .
this beach is beautiful .
some people go snorkeling on their vacations to location .
the man had never been to location , and he was very excited that he was going to vacation there .
one of the first things he saw was a lighthouse standing majestically .
the trip included many adventures , including trips out to the sea on a boat .
he also spent time hiking along the rocky shores of the beaches .
on his final day , he went snorkeling , and say many strange and exotic fish !
[female] loved visiting location . she visited at least once a year .
she absolutely loved the scenery . she loved the tall skyscrapers . especially the beautiful lighthouses .
[female] would go to the sandy beaches and think about her life and how it would be if she moved to location .
she would take many pictures . everywhere she went she was sure to snap a picture or two .
[female] would mostly enjoy stopping by location 's aquariums . they were filled with amazing looking fish . some [female] had never seen before . [female] loved that about location .
our office holiday party started out as a lot of fun .
one of our coworkers had a bit too much to drink , but she enjoyed herself .
she might have second thoughts when she wakes up with this mustache .
the vp ended up with a funny mustache on his neck .
and it was all captured in pictures for the office scrapbook .
this is my older sister at her birthday party .
she 's opening gifts .
my little sister broke out a pack of fake mustaches .
obviously , i had to try one on .
even my wife was wearing one by the end of the night .
we were all opening gifts .
she got a nice shirt dress !
we also had fun with some mustaches .
both guys and girls did !
even the old ones !
we threw a party to celebrate my friend 's birthday .

some of our friends took pictures for us .
today is going to be spent at the beach .
my buddies are getting ready to set up our beach camp .
the bananas look out of place laying next to the water .
standing tall , i feel the power of the tide coming in .
the enormity of the water places a powerful image in my mind .
we went to the beach .
we got settled with friends .
the features were amazing .
so many people were there !
we even brought our dogs !
my team and i went to the beach to see what we could do to help the animals nearby .
we prepped to go into the water to rescue the animals .
we found bananas floating nearby that someone had just thrown away .
i stood on a rock and contemplated life .
we left frustrated , but with a feeling that we were doing some good .
i got up early for a walk on the beach .
there were surfers out prepping their boards .
i ate a banana , a peel is ok to throw in the ocean , right ?
i climbed up on a rock to get a better view .
the ocean was stunning , i was glad i went out .
the tour group took us to the coast for the day .
it was lunch time so people were getting their lunches out .
someone dropped some bananas into the water .
after lunch we admired the view of the ocean .
this day was a great day to come to the coast and enjoy the waves .
the beach is always such beautiful scenery .
the waves wash the upon the shores with such calmness .
seeing the footprints in the sand of all visitors is relaxing .
watching the sun set over the mountains is such a beautiful sight .
as it darkens the scenery is nearly perfect .
our vacation was amazing ! the resort was very nice and clean .
there were many trees and it was very green .
the beaches were not too crowded and the ocean was blue .
we walked barefoot on the beach for hours .
we just could n't get enough of the scenery and walked for most of the vacation .
the other day , i stopped at the beach near my house .
i walked along the shore for a while , seeing if i could find anything interesting .
i came to a little peninsula and decided to sit and watch the sunrise .
as the sun came up over the hillside , i was struck with awe and joy .
a few clouds moved in , but it was the most gorgeous view .
my family and i had a relaxing vacation at the beach .
one of my favorite activities was walking in the sand .
we walked for miles and miles at the sandy beach . .
at the end of the day we were rewarded with a glorious sunset .
the clouds looked like smoke as the day ended and the sun set .
the couple was having a romantic evening .
they walked on the beach .
they let the water run over their feet .
then they watched the sunset .
the sun slowly sank down .
they went on a boat ride .
the boat passed under the bridge on the way into the city .
being beneath the bridge gave a new perspective of it to the viewer .
they made it to the dock and walked into the city .
the walk was filled with beautiful plants .
the post for danger of any kind are in place to the area .
the sky view and beyond the horizons are beautiful .
into the waters and the sand base beach along the side of the city is quiet and nice .
the entrance to the bridge shows well secure stability while crossing .
the long overpass over the water is similar to the location location location .
after a long night of drinking i awoke on a boat .
i was slowly passing under a bridge i began to black out again .
i awoke on dry land this time looking up at this very strange fixture .
i got up and started walking towards the city .
but i blacked out again and woke up in a lovely garden .
look at this beautiful pool in the hotel .
great picture of the bridge .
the under part of the bridge .
skyscrapers in the distance .
pretty purple flowers on a spring day .
the new attraction by the beach is finally coming to a close . a tall light faces the boardwalk .
the mountains in the background are gorgeous .
a boardwalk goes out to the ocean for fishermen of all ages .
the city near the ocean is gorgeous and has a large clock .
a bridge leads from the city back into the main part of the city .
i was by the water .
then i went to the hotel .
this was my room .
it was nice .
then i ate .
this is the hotel we stayed at while on vacation .
they were building on while we were there .
they had very nice rooms .
they also had a restaurant inside the hotel .
the food was delicious .
being on the water , this hotel is a great place for recreation .
it is also close to the city for shopping , dining , movies and etc .
the rooms of the hotel are bright and clean .
even people traveling for work ca n't help but smile when sitting at the pink desk chair .
home style meals at the hotel restaurant keep guests full and happy .
i am off on a vacation by myself . a much needed vacation .
i love the palm trees in front of the hotel .
look at that big , comfy bed i will have all to myself !
i decided to take myself out for dinner .
i 'm not exactly sure what this meal was , but it was delicious !
we closed in on the hotel we where staying at .
it looked huge even from the distance .
we checked in and got ready to go out .
we saw a restaurant and decided to eat there .
the food was very unique and different .
i woke in the morning to a lovely view of nature .
the trees were green and lush and the sky was blue .
i took my car to get closer to the cemetery .
the cemetery had very many tombstones .
near the end of the cemetery was a peaceful and serene lake .
what a wonderful day to enjoy mother nature .
the ride is full of scenic fields of green .
rock walls along the road are capturing my spirit .
a tiny brook meanders throughout the woods .
the current in the brook becomes interesting to me .
i am self-employed so i get to enjoy the festivities of life on my own time .
i hiked up the mountain to see this incredible view .
i traveled by car for the occasion .
i visited a graveyard that was next to the mountains .
lastly , i ended up near the river .
the day promised to be a beautiful one . the sky was mostly clear and blue .
they found themselves driving through a magical green countryside .
the road wove through tunnels of gray rock , and the sound of their tires echoed as they passed .
they left the car behind and discovered a burbling brook leading through the woods .
the air was cool and fresh , filled with the sounds of water splashing the rocks . they wished they could stay here forever .
what a beautiful day ! we 're high up in the hills . let 's go for a drive and explore .
everyone into the car . look at the lovely green scenery .
the road looks interesting . what 's around the bend ?
let 's stop at the river and take a walk . stretch our legs after the drive .
careful , do n't slip ! the water looks cool but we better not go too far from the road . what a great day out ,
we went to the beach at winter last year .
we had some trouble finding an entrance .
once on the beach , it was really cold .
the fog reduced visibility .
it looked neglected and you could tell it was off season for beach going .
the beach was so hazy today . could hardly see .
why is the only road out of here closed ? ? ? how do we get out ?
what the hell is that ? ! ! looks like a bunch of zombies coming toward us .
not sure i want to try to leave that way either .
zombies are getting closer . it 's either get eaten or jump ... think i 'll jump !
it has been storming all day . the access road for the beach has been closed .
from this view , you ca n't make out the beach at all .
you can see the surf is stronger than usual .
the fog is so thick you can hardly make out the pier .
i hope the retainer wall works .
after the storm died down a bit , we decided to take a walk to look at the damage .
the bridge was still up , but the beach looked ominous as we approached .
all that was left of the pier were a few pilings sticking up from the water .
the entire pier had the majority of it 's wood washed completely out to sea .
some of the boardwalk had been picked up and placed on it 's side from the powerful storm .
the storm had blown the gate shut
and caused much fog .
the bridge was falling
into the water .
then washed up onto shore .
[male] was ready for a party on the boat..
he enjoyed the food and the drink..
until , he was sea sick from the food and drink ... .
since , [male] had left , his brother , [male] , decided to show off his speedo..
and , everyone but [male] and [male] were happy to be heading back to shore .
the families got together to go out on the water .
they unpacked their things into their sleeping quarters .
they went to the top deck to enjoy lunch after unpacking .
it was nice to catch up with each other .
the rest of the day was spent relaxing on the water .
my boss invited us on his sailboat . it has all the modern conveniences below deck .
we were served a fresh lobster dinner .
boss sat back and soaked up the rays while letting others steer the boat .
some of the guys regretted not bringing a fishing pole .
instead of fishing , we stopped here and did some snorkeling .
this was the crew quarters on the fishing vessel .
this was our fair weather dining room on the trip .
hanging out the laundry and enjoying the fresh air .
getting ready to go diving to fix the net .
these were a series of small islands were the sharks were plentiful .
the family is going on a boating trip
and were having fun down under .
they were eating outside
and taking photos
before enjoying the view .
ok , this is us acting goofy at work . i lost a bet so i dress like a girl .
reviewing all our `` important '' policies here .

some hazing to get the training going in the right direction .
the ladies making fun of the men in the unit .
some good chow to fill up on after a long day of training .
we did some work in the field before heading in .
we hated having to leave the beach .
we got back to base and it was all business .
we took a quick leak before the night kicked off .
we got beer , ordered pizza and got to it .
the soldiers decided to have fun on their down time .
they put up decorations and posters on the walls .
then they had push up contests .
after that they relaxed with a few drinks .
at the end of the day , they all sat down together to share stories .
shenanigans always start when i dress up .
just thinking about super heros makes me proud of my costume .
the loser of the costume contest has to get down and give me 20 .
sometimes you just have to sit back and enjoy the winning .
a meal always brings us back together no matter who wins or loses .
the sky was blue and orange in the morning .
we traveled to the cove to get an overcast shot .
we found three boats near the shore .
my friends suggested we approach the beach .
we found many other people going to the beach at this time of day .
this is a beautiful view from our vacation
we swam in the cove for a whole day
we toured the city .
and took in all the views along the way .
one last drive by our swimming cove on the way home
i went on vacation to location this year .
the blue seas were gorgeous , as were the rising hills beyond .
some sailboats were left before for our use .
each night , i walked into town for dinner .
the people were tremendously friendly .
this dock is where people relax during the day .
these people are catching some sun .

the family decided to go on a trip overseas .
the first stop there were quite a few people out and about .
the second stop there was less people so we enjoyed it more .
this traffic was the least fun of out trip .
the eiffel tower was our favorite stop .
location is a beautiful place . the scenery just ca n't be beat .
just about every building looks like it was designed by some architectural genius .
the churches are really something else . rarely see anything like this back home .

of course , could n't possibly miss out on the location location either . was worth the trip for this alone .
this ranch was by the ocean .
the family was happy to be out of the city .
they could hear the sounds of the ocean from their bed and breakfast .
the view from this perch was beautiful .
the whole family really loved their weekend away from the city .
me and my friend [male] went backpacking this year .

every house was fitted with its own personal firehouse compartment .
this house has stood here for years despite its dangerous location .
i went on a trip to the countryside . i found this sign quite funny .
[female] did n't want her picture taken .
the ocean was nearby .
the hydrant and hose box stood in stark contrast to each other .
i climbed way up high to the top of a summit and took this picture of a lighthouse .

the plane allowed him to see so much of hte landscape .
he could see the lake and the forest all at once .

flying in the plane , we could see every little detail of the land beneath .
we saw the expanse of the river and the houses near it .
we also saw a large building surrounded by trees .
we even flew over a large empty baseball field .
sitting up near the pilot was exciting , and there were many beautiful sights to be seen .

here 's cutie [male] with his snorkelling gear on once we got into the water .
after that , we ended the day together . happy times !
[male] had a great time canoeing on the lake this summer .
from the top of the beach house we rented we had a bird 's eye view of the waterfront .
the bridge that led up to our beach houses shows how beautiful the trees were surrounding it .
[male] our lab was anticipating his afternoon walk with [male] on the beach .
we took this final shot of ourselves on the beach during our walk . we had a great summer .
yesterday we went out to the lake and rented a boat to row across it .
there were only five boats available .
there were a lot of big houses built around the lake .
we saw this dog in one of the yards .
we had a lot of fun on the lake i hope we can do it again soon .
[male] sat reading his book , relaxing and enjoying the final days of his and [female] 's honeymoon .
he would miss the sprawling beach and calming waters once they returned to the city .
he had so enjoyed their first time kayaking .
the snorkeling was so fun ; he 'd had no idea so much wildlife existed off the coast .
their last day spent , [male] and [female] took one last photo to remember their special weekend by .
we were relaxing in our vacation home over the warm summer .
we had a wonderful view of the clear blue ocean .
after a while of relaxing , we decided to go out and kayak over the water .
we also did a bit of snorkeling .
the day was lovely , and we all had fun together .
the group took a trip to a deserted beach .
they decided to go up the mountain to get a better view .
from the top they could see the full lagoon .
it was truly a beautiful sight .
after the great day they began their walk home .
after hiking all day the group was excited to see water .
it was absolutely breathtaking !
most of the group had never seen anywhere so unique .
the water was so blue !
the white sand was untouched .
ocean islands are amazingly beautiful .
there are truly miracles and beautiful sites everywhere .
around every turn is something breathtaking .
the bluest beaches one has seen .
even the land scenery is amazing .
there was once a sand dune that was super lonely .
and then one day people came .
they admired it 's natural beauty .
the way it 's cliffs jutted out over the water ,
and the way it 's sand was bright and hot from the sun 's light .
the pirate departed the beach , map in hand , to find the fabled buried treasure .
he found the first landmark , the stone hand reaching from the depths .
next , he passed through the eye of wall .
at last , he reached the island where the treasure was hidden .
he stared out across the vast wasteland and gathered his thoughts before traversing toward the x on his map .
i went shopping today and i did n't know i would buy the big blue bottle of detergent .
after i took some time to think if i wanted to buy that i browsed the other items .
should i get powdered gain instead .
on the way out i stopped to get my kids some of the toys out of the quarter machine .
on the way out i saw the fork lift and i thought of all the cool things i could do with that .
getting some fruits , some apples and kiwis .
and some tangerines before going to the beach .
on our way to the beach .
arrived at the beach , no one is there yet .
going for a swim , the water is crystal clear .
i went to the store and purchased some apples .
the oranges looked too good to pass up , so i had to buy some of them too .
as i was driving home , i thought about how beautiful of a day it was .
i decided i had to make a quick stop at the beach .
as i stared at the water , i noticed a pretty flower just floating in the water .
took a trip to the grocery store . needed some supplies .
needed some laundry detergent and some food .
why do they have so many choices .
ca n't leave any store without getting one of these .
what kind of car is that ?
a quick trip to the store was needed for stocking up .
while there , many types of laundry products were considered .
it was decided that gain was the detergent to buy .
as the buyer left the store , they passed by impulse buy machines .
in the parking lot , the buyer noticed a large forklift parked nearby .
for our 50th wedding anniversary we had a gourmet dinner .
then we went to the beach to watch the sunset .
i had to dip my toes in the water .
me and my love watch the sun as we count our blessings .
50 years and we love each other more each day . here is to the next 50 years . i love you !
walking along the shore .
taking a picture of the beautiful sunset .
husband and wife enjoying the sunset together .
then they went to a restaurant to eat a creme brÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â»lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e for desert .
desert was a success .
the old couple had a nice dinner .
after that , they went for a walk .
they took of their shoes to feel the ocean water against their feet .
they stopped for a moment and turned to their left .
they watched the sunset happily .
the couple is walking on the beach .
they are going to go eat afterwards .
the both like fancy food .
these dishes are plated artistically .
the couple enjoys the vibrant visual food .
on our trip to the beach we got to see many nice sunsets .
each night i would bring out my camera and take a photo .
my wife and i love to look at the beach together .
the food we would eat at dinner was delicious .
each meal was prepared for healthiness and tasted great .
our friend is a professional photographer .
he is known for his pictures of bands .
he also takes photos of urban exploration sites .
our favorite pictures from him are his landscape photos .
most of his work comes from portrait pictures .
photography is a great art form .
landscapes make for great photographs .
the artist has a keen eye .
she posed for a picture .
an old tractor makes a great picture .
this camera can take high quality shots .
this field shot was taken with that camera .
the camera can also take black and white pictures .
there is also a portrait mode .
the camera is good for taking shots anywhere .
today my friends and i bought a camera .
we got 5 of the guys together and were going to make a manly film of sorts .
we got a shabby apartment to shoot in . manly .
we found a storm to film . manly .
but [male] , the cameraman , would n't stop filming his girlfriend ...
i bought a new camera over the weekend and wanted to test it out .
i went outdoors and took many pictures of the plains .
i even tried to take some artistic photos .
i asked my friends to pose for me .
i also went inside forests to take pictures .
the view of the island from the shoreline was amazing .
the children were happy to have a beach day .
the man wanted to look cool at the beach .
the man caught a huge fish .
the sailboats were all aligned as they prepared to go out to sea .
this weekend we went on our annual beach trip .
we got lunch at our favorite spot on the beach .
the kids were very excited as usual .
we got up early to see the sail boats on the beach .
overall it was a great trip !
my family and i decided to rent a beach house on a tropical island for a summer getaway vacation .
my two younger brothers played on the beach all day long , making sand castles and tumbling in the ocean waves .
of course , i could n't help but take a picture of myself with the ocean -- it was too beautiful not to !
while we played , we saw some local fishermen making their money for the day .
in the middle of the day , we watched a sailing competition start , which was a lot of fun to view .
the family is relaxing at the lake .
these two kids like the ocean .
dad loves being in the sun .
they caught a fish to eat later .
everyone had a great time at the beach .
i took my family to the beach yesterday .
we had a lot of fun there .
the weather was great .
we found some local fishermen there .
there were some people getting ready to wind surf .
i spent all day walking along the beach .
i wanted to see what i could find .
there were many rocks on the beach .
i got to look at a few of them up close .
they were very old .
we drove to a deserted beach .
it was a perfect day . the sky was bright blue with a few puffy clouds .
there was not another soul in sight .
we saw shells and coral which were exposed at low tide .
we expected shells - but were surprised to see a beautiful green lizard !
our family went to the beach to find our friend smokey the alligator .
smokey has lived on this beach for longer than some of us have been alive .
we usually set this point and follow tracks our father finds towards our friend smokey .
these shells and prints indicated to our dad that smokey is not far off .
finally , we found smokey going for a stroll ! we took pictures from afar and headed back home .
the beach was rocky but gorgeous .
this view was absolutely striking .
these rocks were very interesting and fun to explore .
a few closeups to show their interesting texture .
this one in particular was very unique .
the beach is a great place
there is so much to see
when the tide is coming in animals come around
and there all all kinds of seashells
there was even a lizard
it was a beautiful city on the coast .
the view was spectacular .
the golden dome was beautiful next to the azure sea .
we enjoyed the beautiful old buildings and marvelous ocean vistas .
the best spot of all was the fabulous old cathedral with palm trees in front .
we went to morocco
it was amazing
i am so glad i went there
i hope to go back
it was a great experience
the city has thousands of inhabitants .
the city has been here for hundreds of years .
these buildings are 100 years old .
the main income for the city comes from the sea .
this church is a historic landmark in the coastal city .
the family took it 's vacation to location this year .
this is the view from our hotel .
the city below is magnificent .
the sky could n't be a deeper shade of blue .
after this photo we will go see the sights .
took a trip to location . it 's beautiful here in the summertime .
this is the balcony to my hotel room .
i 'm headed to that buildng .
i 'm on a helicopter .
here i am , almost landing . having a good time .
i was very tired when i got up to the mountain .
it was a long ski walk .
we went for many miles .
everyone was tired .
i had some water to drink .
today was a good day to get away and go skiing .
the slopes were calling our name .
we needed to get a picture before skiing .
the snow was ready to go .
i always practice safety first when skiing .
we finally reached the skiing place .
we put on our gear , ready to set out .
the smooth looking snow looks so pretty .
too bad we had to ski over it .
my buddy looks like he 's not enjoying himself though since he keeps falling .
a lot of people had already left a lot of tracks .
as i moved down the hill , i saw more and more .
at the mid-way point , i even passed a bunch of resting skiers .
but then , the mountain was mine alone .
it was almost night so i made it back just in time , but i never want to forget .
we headed out into the snow .
it was the perfect weather for snow skies .
we got geared up and got to it .
we had a lot of room to work with .
afterwards , we took some pictures and left .
[male] was on his annual skiing trip with his best but [male] .
[male] showed up just a few minutes after [male] did .
they began setting camp up , nightfall was coming very quickly .
once the tents were set up they knew they would have to cook soon .
so they sat around a fire and started setting dinner up .
when i took this picture of us camping , i never knew it was look like art work .
the view of the snow glistening against the water , makes for a breathtaking photo .
as the sun set , we all took some time to enjoy mother nature .
i took some time for some self reflection , and this view helped me to calm down .
the sun is almost set , and it amazes me how , the waters calmed down .
[male] loved cross country skiing .
[female] was having a great time too .
they decided to stop and make camp .
first they pitched the tent .
then they built a fire and sat by it until they went to bed .
a few friends went on a weekend trip to the mountains .
their first activity was going skiing .
after a long day on the slopes , they headed back to their camp site .
they had put up their tents to prepare for a cold night .
at the end of the day , they all gathered around the warm fire and enjoyed each others company .
it was time for a snowy adventure !
i was fully loaded and ready for action !
the snowy scene was just gorgeous !
i passed this wonderful scene and felt wonderful !
at the end of the day the fire was the best part !
this guy played for the whole night at our favorite restaurant .
here is a close up of dom the musician !
my friend was allowed to join in , since it was his birthday !
happy birthday , buddy !
group photo after our fun night out .
we had a great mini vacation . it started with a family party .
there was some nice local wine there .
then we headed over to the beech
the waves were crashing in , it was a beautiful sight .
my wife then wanted to pose with the water in the background , it was a great trip .
our little get together turned out to be quite a turn out .
i really enjoyed playing my guitar for everyone .
we even got a little banging from the tambourine player .
a couple of friends posed to take pictures for memories .
now we are posing together for a last picture together . a picture of best friends forever .
we all got together at [male] [male] 's bar and grill .
[male] decided to show off his mad skills on the guitar
phillipo provided an impromptu vocal cameo .
we reminisced over a glass of red wine .
one group photo for the road .
on the weekends i play my guitar at a local restaurant .
i play many different tunes that my friends sing along to .
here is my friend [male] , he came out to support me .
[male] brought his brother along to hear me play .
here is the entire gang at the end of another great show !
viewing the frozen beach .
we can still have fun in the sun .
frozen , but still romantic .
hard to get a sun tan today .
that is how cold it was .
we had a photo shoot done for our engagement .
i love the way the pictures turned out .
it may have been cold , but our hearts are warm .
this was my absolute favorite picture .
this shot was cool , i love the ice .
i watched a lovely couple exploring the city despite the cold weather .
i asked them if i could take there picture , and they posed for me .
i took the rest of my shots from a distance as they carefully walked on the ice .
although the guy spotted me and posed for another shot .
then they went off into the distance .
a day was spent admiring the city in the winter .
from a chilly beach the couple took a picture of the frozen water .
they meandered along a pier admiring the beauty of the ice .
leaning over the side , the man observed just how solid the icy structure was .
the long , pointed icicles signaled a slow , solemn stream of water droplets .
on our trip to the city we got to enjoy the snow .
my boyfriend and me played around in the snow for hours .
the waterfall had frozen over and we had to be careful not to slip .
my boyfriend leaned over the edge to see what it would look like .
we walked away from the waterfall enjoying our day .
i spent xmas in location location
it was a great time
it was so relaxing
i loved my suite
and the pool was great
i went on a vacation to location location .
the hotel was beautiful .
the city was cleaner than i imagined .
the beaches had beautiful blue water and clear sand .
the climate is perfect for tanning .
i spent christmas at location
my hotel was huge .
the room i got was very nice .
it had a imac and a tv .
i spent a lot of time at the pool .
i decided to take a much needed holiday .
i arrived at my hotel around the afternoon .
my room was luxurious and comfy .
i relaxed on the bed and watched some tv .
i ended up taking my relaxation out by the pool .
a vacation was taken to location beach .
the hotel was located in a very scenic area .
accommodations were quite nice . the beds were very comfy .
the room was well supplied with all manner of gadgets .
once the travelers were settled , they headed to the pool .
we finally took a week 's vacation to visit the sea . here we are by the water .
we heard about this fascinating fort overlooking the water and had to check it out .
a storm rolled in from the ocean threatening to ruin our plans for the evening .
but luck was with us . the skies cleared and the fading clouds brought a beautiful sunset .
the lights from the city came on and i toasted our good fortune , and how wonderful it was to share this place with someone .
time for our romantic boat cruise !
here 's our small craft that ought to take us around the island .
by mid afternoon , we were still very close to shore , and could see the lighthouse .
it 's nightfall , and we still have n't really left the shore area . this boat is slow .
our boat has finally made some headway into the water , and we caught sight of a huge castle !
we wanted to spend some time together here .
the city was built on the edge of the cliff .
the clouds covered the sky .
the sun was beginning to set .
the city seemed to go to sleep after sunset .
we took a vacation together .
the old city was beautiful .
here is a pier to fish from .
the sunset and clouds looks scary .
we drank some wine and put our glowing bracelet around the base .
we made our way out to the dock .
we got in a boat and headed out .
after a whiel , we went back to walk the beach .
we did that till sunset and turned around .
the next morning we continued our adventure .
it was quite an adventure . we ran into a white sea urchin ...
and , this tiny sandcrab , which was as small as your pinky
then we found the black sea urchin , the cousin of the white one .
as we were walking , a crab spotted us and it scuttled off ...
we chased it into the rocks and then went home .
scavenging the beach for sea creatures .
found a tiny sand crab .
a colorful crab climbing a rock .
and scuttling off sideways when disturbed .
and finally a sea urchin found in a tide pool .
we arrived early to begin our day at the beach .
pretty quickly , we even found a tiny sandcrab !
there were also surprising things hidden in the rocks .
the crab we found was probably more afraid of us than we were him .
right before we left , we found a sea urchin that the tide pool had washed up .
my day on the beach was so cool . i found this little prickly thing under my foot , ouch !
this tiny sand crab was attached to my butt cheek ! it pinched me while i was sitting in the sand .
this sea urchin was so lucky to be our lunch . we cracked him open and roasted him over a fire .
this cool little purple crab followed me around . i think he smelled sea urchin on my breath .
i finally snapped a picture of him and told him to stop following me or i 'd eat him next . he stayed back .
i decided to photograph sea creatures .
this was a sandcrab i found .
this crab was looking back at me
this crab seemed scared a bit .
this sea urchin was really amazing .
the couple went to the aquarium .
the saw beautifully colored jellyfish .
some of the fish made the people look like ants .
this guy looked mildly irritated at the audience .
these fish seemed to produce their own light .
the ocean is home to so much life .
from the beautiful blue fish that looks like dory from nemo
to the small yellow fish .
the sea anemone is a species of plant even though it looks like it is alive .
but my very favorite is the beautiful jellyfish .
this is a day trip to an aquarium , where families can come .
you can look through the glass and observe the fish up close .
there are a lot of people in the deep aquarium that come and see the fish .
there are all different kinds of different fish some really big and some small .
the fish and the sea creatures all make a colorful scene for the viewers .
it 's her birthday so he took her to her favorite place , the aquarium .
there were jelly fish .
and large fish that none of us had ever seen .
it seems the fish were just as curious as we were .
but much more colorful .
we went to a local aquarium .
we saw orange jellyfish .
then we saw some schools of bony fish .
there was a huge fish swimming the tank too . he looked mean !
lastly , there were some smaller fish who lived in reefs . they were very colorful !
[male] arrived a little late but made his way to the group .
on the way he passed the tree that [female] told him about .
[female] met [male] in front of the shore to show him where the group was .
they walked and talked about how much fun they had the last time everyone hung out .
the rest of the group was happy that [male] made it safely and ran to greet him .
it was finally starting to feel like fall outside .
the leaves were falling off the trees .
the sun was going down faster .
but being around the lake is nice
fall really is my favorite time of the year .
i went to the beach one evening .
there were some people there .
when it was getting dark people began to leave .
i had a great time hanging out there .
it was getting late so i went back home .
the man was outside exploring the world .
he saw a tree from his childhood and wanted a closer look .
he saw the lake and it reminded him of the trips he used to take there with his grandpa .
he walked around the lake taking in new perspectives .
he enjoyed it a lot and stayed many hours there .
took a trip to a place we called old tree when i was a kid .
this tree brings back memories .
strolling along i can remember a time when we camped and had fun here .
now i come back as a grown up and ca n't wait to bring my family here .
watching all the people play makes me want to get married .
the desert is a brutal place in the summer .
it dries up all vegetation .
it cracks the earth with its heat .
but as in life there is always an oasis .
arms around each other we strolled off . satisfied with what we saw .
i went on a tour around location last weekend .
there was beautiful scenery of many plants and cacti .
there was also a great pond in the middle of the hiking trails .
there was also some great looking trees on the other side of the pond .
i got a great shot of my girlfriend in a sepia color at the pond as well .
we went on a nice anniversary vacation to the desert .
it feels good to be alive around all these dead things .
there were cracks in the ground and my wife got a little scared . i told her it was normal .
finally some water and trees ! we made it out of the desert to a paradise .
it was a great adventure with the one i love the most !
our trip to the desert was really interesting .
we saw tumbleweeds for the first time !
it was amazing to see how dry the ground was .
the palm trees were just gorgeous .
it was a romantic trip for us !
we decided to take a trip to the desert today .
it was extremely hot .
it was so dry that the ground began to crack .
we finally found some water .
we both took many pictures together .
the group was on a roadtrip .
they rented a yellow sports car .
the car was fun to drive .
once they reached their destination they were excited to fish .
[male] caught a fish soon after getting on the boat .
it was a mistake staying up all night and partying before the early morning deep sea fishing trip .
[male] fell asleep late and it was hard to wake him up .
it was so early that it was still dark outside .
they made it on the boat and no one managed to puke the whole way .
the fruit of their spoils , fresh caught fish .
fishing trip with the lads . no girls allowed .
i said no girls allowed ! wait ... [male] ?
well we sent [male] home , he 's obviously feeling a bit [male] jenner , and now we 're ready to turn in for the night ready for a day 's fishing tomorrow .
full steam ahead captain ! there 's some prime fishing waters to the location and we 're ready to plunder the seas of their booty .
that 's right , that 's my fish . it 's the ugliest fish in the world but it 's getting mounted on my wall . oh yeah !
a group of friends decided to take a fishing trip in location .
they drove a beautiful yellow roadster .
although only two of them could fit in the car at one time .
they arrived to the marina as a large ship was being pulled into the ocean .
after the boat was pulled into the ocean , they finally got on the water and caught their first fish .
they almost arrived to the ocean to do some fishing .
then they saw a classic car on the road .
they got in closer for a better look .
after that they finally arrived to the ocean .
they spent the rest of the day fishing in the ocean .
[male] and [male] were unsure of what would happen when they arrived at location location ...
however , [male] quickly found his ray-ban 's , and hit the town .
he met his old friend [male] and they were off .
his camera was quickly stolen by [female] , a high school friend .
who , ended the night with a selfie .
there were lots of people .
some had flowers .
some had sunglasses .
some had mustaches .
and some wore lipstick .
i photographed portraits of the gay couples in my hometown . the first couple was a bi-racial couple who had been together for 5 yers .
the next was a sweet couple who had been together for 12 years .
the next couple told me about how one of them use to be a cop .
the met on the job and they 've been together ever since .
the last couple was a bit more unusual . one of them loved to dress in drag . i learned a lot while doing this project and i hope to learn more in the future .
my boyfriend and i went to a picnic hosted by our friends .
this is [male] .
this is [male] and his significant other . they are a great couple .
our friends [female] and duke were there too .
[female] looking lovely , as always .
the family was taking photos together
and with flowers .
one guy just liked his glasses
but was joined by another .
they were very happy at the end .
we stayed at this hotel while on vacation .
this was the view from our room .
our room was pretty nice .
later in the evening we wandered downtown .
they had some very pretty buildings in the city .
our trip has begun . this is a photo of our room . it is very roomy and spacious . i have really enjoyed it !
this is a photo of the resort . it is stationed in the old city . as you can tell , the resort is an older one .
this is the resort from another view . even though it is old , it is very beautiful and we love it !
this is a tree right outside of the resort . it has been here for years .
this is the road right near the resort . it is very curvy ! i did not like driving on it .
their hotel had retro decor , but it was room and clean , and had modern conveniences such as a flat screen tv .
it was the architecture of the building that really impressed them .
the man could n't help but stare at at the wood doors and pillared roof .
even the trees were perfectly shaped .
their trip would n't have been complete , however , if they had n't traveled down the hill to the gorgeous beach .
the beach in front of the hotel was nice but we needed to check in .
the view back from the hotel was perfect .
w checked in , dropped our bags off and headed out .
we walked down a few streets seeing the sights .
then , we came up to an old building and continued our adventure .
the room was very organized
in the big hotel .
that had many cars in front
and a big tree outside .
there was a winding road nearby .
they had heard great things about [male] 's .
they had to give it a shot .
it was such a happy day .
the rides were calling them .
many prizes were won .
my wife really enjoyed the food on vacation .
i convinced her to take me to this theme park .
my friend and i washed out hands in the fountain .
we used the bridge to get closer to the city 's shoreline .
when we could not find a beach , we took pictures of the water from the bridge .
we took the kids to location location on a bright sunny day . our first stop was the historic [male] 's hot dog stand .
the food was delicious and we even caught our son with far too much in his mouth . a great experience to eat at this original iconic place !
our daughter gave us a great big smile after we told her were we going over to the midway !
the children were very excited once the saw the large location wheel .
the little one even won a pink squirting dolphin for the midway and it matched her outfit !
[male] and his sister [female] love hotdogs . so they always stop and eat at the nathans inside of the amusement park .
they 'd eat all that they could before walking the amusement park walks ways to digest their food before getting on any rides .
[female] stops and smiles after playing a game . [male] snaps her photo .
[male] and [female] get on the big ferris wheel together . the organization wheel is there favorite ride .
lastly , [male] takes a photo of the prize [female] won at one of the games she played . she will hang the prize on her bedroom wall with all the others she won from their previous trips .
the family spent the day at the boardwalk .
they sampled food from several restaurants .
the youngest in the family was having a great time !
her favorite ride was the big ferris wheel .
she won several of the games and kept her new found friend in her pocket .
we , finally arrived at the beach .
the lighthouse in the distance was a great sight .
however , [male] , an action figure , was not prepared for the strong waves that were occurring .
he thought it had settled down and was ready to float away ...
until , he was knocked to the bottom from a strong wave . what a day [male] experienced .
we went to the beach today . no one was there , which was nice .
here is a photo of the waves . look at the beautiful colors in the water .
the light house is isolated here . it is not near the pier or where beach goers usually sit .
do n't worry , i did not put [male] in the water ! this is actually a sculpture that stays on the beach .
i did find some little friends while on my walk . these guys look like they are guarding their turf !
[male] thought the beach was relaxing .
but he thought the lighthouse in the middle of the ocean looked even more serene .
he decided to enjoy a beer in his favorite recliner , while he floated in the water to that relaxing lighthouse .
soon , he fell asleep , dreaming about a night in the quiet lighthouse , away from his nagging wife . he was too drunk to realize he was no longer floating , but instead had been stranded on the sand .
he had n't been napping long , when a big wave pulled him back in the water and splashed him in the face . he slept right through it all . that was the last anyone ever saw of him . it 's rumored he lives in the lighthouse , enjoying the silence .
some really cool drift wood by the beach .
this must have been gas or oil from a spill somewhere .
a neat lighthouse by the beach .
someone had set this blow up doll adrift .
some crabs enjoying the beach like we were .
the tree was on the beach
and there was glass too .
a lighthouse
had a guy in a chair near
with crabs at his feet .
the ducks have taken over the dock . we need to get past them .
off to explore the water and nature . it was exhausting paddling the entire time .
back on shore , we moved the canoes to the water by the cabin .
got back to the cabin to eat some dinner .
found this on my car when i went out to make sure it was locked . guess i ticked off someone .
they went out on the lake in a canoe .
there were other people canoeing as well .
they stopped to take a picture in the shallow water .
they even saw the remains of a tree .
when they returned they had to get the canoe out of the water .
the family took a break from city life and had a vacation in the country . they enjoyed the quiet of the lake .
then father and son went on a canoe ride .
while the other sons were carrying their canoe to the lake .
by the time the other sons arrived at the lake , the father and other son were already done with their ride , so they played in the water while the two boys paddled out into the water .
the family enjoyed being at the lake much more than the town people enjoyed having them their . the locals really just did n't like the way they parked their car .
ducks walking along the dock at the lake .
canoeing through the grass at the edge of the lake .
[male] , [male] , and [male] carrying the canoe out of the water .
[male] and [male] testing out the canoe to make sure they did n't break it .
dad got this note on his car for a bad parking job .
the canoe trip was going quite well
they were in the water
before they decided to go out
when they noticed something
a small sign that was a warning .
we were enjoying the sunset and fell asleep .
as we awoke the next morning ...
we realized we were headed for the dock .
the boat would n't start ; however , [male] continued to attempt to slow the boat .
yet , it was n't enough and we crashed directly into the dock .
beautiful sunset our first night . look how peaceful it is .
the storm a few nights ago washed driftwood and other debris down to in front of our area .
the next morning the sunrise was amazing . gave us a reason to get up .
got all of the debris moved . now we can have dinner .
another beautiful sunset . time to head to bed .
riding down the lakes edge to see what we find .
first was an old building by the side that looked abandoned .
we continued while the sun set down the far side .
we came back across the building again and wondered some more .
as the sun set , we headed back to shore .
we arrived at the lake on friday evening . this is our view from the cabin .
while kayaking , we stumbled upon an abandoned lake house .
we grilled some fish my husband caught and enjoyed the breathtaking view .
i found myself fascinated with this house and attempted to get a closer look .
the weekend ended too quickly and we had to say goodbye to this gorgeous place .
the sunset happened
and showed the ruins .
the concrete had fallen
into the calm water
beside the green trees .
the whole gang got together at the local pizza joint to have a few slices before heading to the beach .
on our way out of the pizza shop jessica pointed out these flowers growing outside of the door .
before long we were at the beach . many of the beach goers were just arriving for the day of fun .
while i waited for the others i took a close up of the entrance sign to the beach .
the girls stood close together for a photo in their new bikini 's .
family having pizza for lunch .
enjoying their pizza .
sisters enjoying the beach and going for a swim .
putting their bathing suits outside to air dry .
no visitors allowed in the hotel rooms .
this is our group when we very first arrived at vacation . we are tired and hungry after all the travelling .
this is one of the flower bushes right outside of the hotel . all the flowers are gorgeous !
our hotel happens to be right on the beach . there is plenty of shopping to do as well as sunbathing .
this is a sign describing the rules of the beach !
a pretty picture of the girls in our group getting ready to sunbathe . we had so much fun !
our family had a get together .
grandma 's plants were flourishing .
the house was a ten minute walk from the beach .

we sunbathed and swam every day we were there .
spending the day with friends !
saw some pretty bushes !
we are at the beach .
love to spend time here !
had a great day swimming and hanging out !
if you 're ever visiting the reno area , i suggest taking a day trip to location location .
there 's a great night life there , where you can gamble at one of their fabulous casinos .
by the day , you can relax at the lake , which is truly gorgeous this time of year .
they also have quite an eclectic variety of neighborhood shops and souvenir stores .
the locals have a great sense of humor , as evidenced by this traffic sign .
on our way to reno we stopped at location location .
we really enjoyed seeing the huge lake , and natural landscape .
we stopped by some local shops to get a taste of the local culture .
we took in some of the local sites like this fire pit some locals had constructed .
finally it was time to move on to reno , our next stop .
we were ready to start our road trip !
the shop was well decorated with lights .
the view of the lake was breath-taking .
we stopped by the store to purchase books and audio .
we had to smile .
the family went on a road trip together .
their first stop was a lovely restaurant with beautiful lighting .
then , they went out to the lake to look at the beautiful scenery .
after , they went to the book store .
they had to get back on the road after that .
we went to location location last week .
we stayed at a nice lodge .
the view of the lake was awesome . we could see the water and beautiful sky !
at one point , we visited a book and music store for souvenirs .
outside , on a pole we saw a great sign which made us smile ! this was a good vacation !
we drove to the beach to do our work for today .
my son came along too and i scouted the waters before we started .
i decided it was a good day to relax instead and i set up the umbrella .
there was plenty food for us and my son .
later that day , we walked around the beach with our hats .
we visited a far away place .
the whole family came and we were together a lot .
we even saw some local people downtown !
the architechture was amazing .
the whole family had a great time !
i went with my family to visit location this year .

i sat on the beach in the sun .
at night we would eat fantastic dinners .
the sea surrounding was a beautiful shade of blue .
we went on a cruise and stopped by small seaside town .
we stopped for lunch is a small restaurant .
after lunch we roam the streets looking at the sights .
we walked around all day long until everyone got tired .
after our walk we sat down to a sunset dinner .
on our way to the beach , we were stopped by a flock of sheep passing in the road .
when we got there , we stopped to check out the boats in the marina .
we finally got to the beach , and it was stunningly beautiful .
later , we went back to the resort for dinner with the kids .
my husband took our oldest and youngest to the overlook to see the tide come in .
the smith family 's summer vacation took them to beautiful location .
there they visited the location location .
the palace is known for its exquisite architecture , and many stairs .
after a few flights of these stairs , the family decided to stop for a photo opportunity .
finally after much climbing , the family made it to the top . the view was breathtaking !
this is where we began our vacation in location . we visited the location location .
many of the buildings are a stunning white color .
the architecture is fascinating .
this long walk way is gorgeous .
we finished the tour of the palace in the gardens . it is amazing how well kept and beautiful they are .
the family went on vacation recently . we all gathered for pictures .
this place was amazing with great architecture .
we toured much of the buildings .
the overlooks from the buildings were great .
outside was even better with all the palm trees .
we arrived as a picturesque location on a beautiful day .
we took a group picture to begin our tour .
we climbed steps that wound around beautiful structures .
along the climb we took another picture .
we were rewarded for out climb with a beautiful view .
we took a trip to the mrigadayan place .
the architecture was amazing inside .
then we followed the stairs up to the top .
after that we came to a long walkway .
the view was breath taking .
hoping to get my portfolio together today . found some awesome scenery .
these trees would look perfect on my livingroom wall .
look at that sunset , it 's orange and yellows make for great pictures .
the trees along this little river make the sky pop .
the dew on the trees make this picture look great .
i recently went to an island to take photography pictures , and i got a beautiful shot of dolphins .
i also got a shot of birds flying over the water .
there were even some wild gazelle wandering around .
the plant life on the island was beautiful as well .
this lone tulip was gorgeous to see .
the dolphins jumped in the sun and it was marvelous .
the birds flew into the deep blue .
there were many animals on the prairie .
the pink flower was moist and had a glow .
it stood very tall and had a unique bend .
the mountain is beautiful .
the trees go up extremely high .
the sunset shines through the clouds .
the sparse lands still looks very lush .
the water droplets hang on for dear life .
my vacation was simply majestic . i saw dolphins leaping out of the sea .
these birds swooped in for a steal .
did this gazelle notice me ? i think he is posing .
the morning dew looked gorgeous on this flower .
this flower leaned towards the light , craving it .
[male] is taking a road trip back to his old school .
he is taking the highway early in the morning .
the sight of the stately buildings brings back memories of his college days .
he drives by the entrance to the engineering school where he spent 5 years .
but his real memories come from seeing the old dormitories . he spent more time there than in those classrooms .
i went to check out a college last weekend .
the student union was huge .
i made sure to see what the dorms were like .
finally i stopped by the administrative office to sign some papers .
it took all day to check out the college but soon enough , we were on our way back home .
i took a road trip this weekend to visit my old college town .
i got there early in the morning just as the sun was coming up .
the old row houses we used to live in looked quiet and cold so early .
the school buildings , too , were deserted .
i turned around in my car and decided to head back home before the sun went down .
[female] was excited to finally get in her car
and get on the road
so she can go back to campus .
she loved her college with all of her heart ,
and was extremely excited to start this new semester .
i took a road trip today .
the roads i took had a lot of twists and turns .
then i came across some old buildings .
after that i came across some beautiful brick buildings .
finally i parked the car and went for a walk .
the sun rose early that morning and i meditated .
then i went to the beach to take pictures of birds .
when i got home , my cat was waiting on the deck for me .
i took her to the beach and then to the pastures .
at the pastures , we both watched these delicate sheep .
after a two hour car trip , we finally arrived for our day at the beach .
the local wildlife greeted us , i think he wanted a french fry .
most of the day was spent fishing , made the family earn their dinner !
here it is ! our first catch of the day !
the sun setting on the horizon was the perfect end to a great day .
it was one hell of a day to go to the beach 15 years ago today .
i saw this lone ranger standing guard over the land to make sure no marine beasts make it to shore .
people were doing their best to make sure they eat as many marine beasts as they could catch , but they could n't match the lone ranger seagull .
lone ranger seagull only had to vanquish one beast on that day , 15 years ago .
some days are a bloodbath for the lone ranger seagull , but this day was nothing compared to the carnage of years past .
location is the perfect getaway for my family .
we got to see a bird perched on a rock in bad weather .
we also befriended a local cat who we now call snookems .
the beach can be cold in the morning .
goats are known to graze the mainland .
we took a trip to the beach to do some fishing on a nice day .
we came across a seagull watching the ocean for fish to eat .
we had really good equipment to do some fishing in the ocean .
we did manage to catch a small fish from the ocean .
at the end of the day the water was so calm and still .
although we arrived at the beach early , a crowd of people was already forming .
close to the shore , the water was rough and you could see white caps .
in the deeper water it was more placid and a beautiful shade of blue .
we had to be careful as we walked along the rocky shoreline , do n't fall in !
there was a pair of salty dogs on the beach , they do n't look too impressed !
seeing the sea side really calms the soul .
deep blue water stretches out towards the beach .
rocks lap up the water from this huge ocean current .
pretty little puppies ask for more food .
so much sand stretching our forever and ever .
our home beach is so beautiful .
the waves bring life to the shore .
the rock formation is so natural .
our dogs love to come to the beach with us .
we are just glad to have the ocean view .
my friends and any dogs went to the beach last week .
the waves were crashing against the shore as we walked the bluff .
further from shore , the ocean looked very calm .
as the tide went out , the crashing of the tide lessened .
at the end of the day , my friends and the dogs were glad for the tides refrain .
our hotel overlooked a large beach .
some areas were choppy and filled with waves .
other parts of the water were quite smooth .
the ocean extended as far as the eye could see .
we saw some cute dogs on the beach as well .
we rode the lift up the mountain .
it kept going up higher and higher , above the town .
we got further away from the town , and could see the mountains .
the view was breath-taking .
what a beautiful way to tour a country !
the view of the clouds from the mountaintops was beautiful .
there was also a very nice beach nearby .
after seeing the beach , we got a great view of the city and the mountains from below .
eventually , we decided to have some fun . there was a very big ladder leading to a zipline .
the view from the zipline was amazing , you could see the whole city from that height .
i took an air tram for the first time today !
it was exciting and scary at the same time .
the view of the city below was magnificent .
the natural beauty of the scenery was majestic high over mountains made of rock and tree .
the last part of the air tram was an scene of the mountains meeting a beautiful hidden mountain lake .
my children wanted to ride the lift .
i told my wife to snap photos on the lift .
we achieved a very high altitude .
when we got really high , the scenery became amazing .
at the top was a genuine view .
we where to go to a rather remote place . much of our travel was on these lifts .
we went so far on the lift that i thought that we would never get off of them .
we got out of the city on the lift . the city looked so good at a distance .
no more city out here . just the remote landscape . it was tranquil .
as we got closer to the water you could see how seer the cliffs where .
we arrived on the island by boat and the harbor was quite a sight .
the view from the shoreline was incredible .
venturing out a little further is nothing but desert , making you forget that the water is nearby .
dont worry thats the good swastika , the one that means good fortune and well being !
back at the beach we set up camp for the night and planned the next days adventure .
there were many nazi structures at the destination that the family decided to visit .
one of them even looked like a temple for worshiping .
there were a lot of boats and ships close by in the water .
after that , we went backpacking in the desert .
finally , we went back to the beach and decided to go wake boarding .
that morning , there we 're many ships in the harbor .
we decided to go to the sandy part of the beach .
we walked in the sand for a few hours .
when we got tl the cemetery , we we 're silent .
the beach was relaxing after the silence .
the little boating village was surprisingly crowded when we got there .
we had to travel for a long time by foot to get to where we where going .
it was a bleak landscape where few things grew high , and the dirt was more like sand .
when we got to here we where so exhausted by our travels .
we camped on the beach for the night . our work would start in the morning .
the family went to tour some historical nazi outposts .
this is the entrance to one of the bunkers .
some fishermen 's boats can be seen in a nearby harbor .
the sand dunes were impressive , so we took off our shoes and ran around .
there was plenty to do on a nearby beach , including paddle boarding !
a bike collector and rider is very excited to show off his new bike .
the collector is very proud of his bike .
he spends a lot of his time travelling on his bike and taking pictures of all of the places he visits , such as this ranch .
here , he takes a picture of his bike next to an old canon .
finally , before going home , he rides to the beach and captures a nice picture of his bike and the beautiful waves .
my bicycle is the best of the bunch , for sure .
thinking bout taking it out for a ride on the beach .
the weather is really perfect for such a bike ride on the beach .
shining through the slats in the boards my only bike shines so bright .
i 'll take pictures of her instead , what a beauty .
in my home , we have a spot for our bikes .
i was looking to sell my oldest bike .
i brought it to the beach to get some nice cover photos .
i parked it be the cannon to give it visible strength .
i even got shots on the dock with my bike .
i have always wanted to bike the county . the one on top is mine .
i took it across the country . i lived my dream and took a pic at one beach .
i went all across the country , and my favorite places where by the water .
i wanted to get a better view of the water with my bike in front . i just remember the cool salty air wafting from the beach .
this is the last moment before i set out of my town . i would not see it for another three months .
my bicycle is my best friend .
i 've had this baby for over five years .
we 've been through a lot together .
i even take her on vacation .
she loves long walks by the shore .
there was a huge fire at the beach yesterday .
the party goers put a lot of wood on the fire .
everyone was dancing .
the fire lasted a long time ago .
i had a great time there .
we had a big bonfire to celebrate summer vacation .
unfortunately it got out of control when someone threw a can of gasoline on it .
i had never seen such a big fire in my life !
it grew more and more out of control and we could not get it extinguished .
it was all fun and games until someone called 911 and the police arrested us all .
i was inside playing a game when i suddenly started to hear a lot of voices gather down the street .
apparently , someone had struck up a fire in a bunch of dry leaves and brush .
the fire raged on , but it did n't seem to be going anywhere , so everyone chatted and watched as it grew larger .
when the fire looked like it was going out of control , people took a step back and notified the police .
by the time the police had arrived to investigate a possible arson , the fire was gone , and no one knew who had started the fire .
fire can be dangerous .
controlled fires can be fun .
you have to be careful around fires regardless of how they came about .
just because a fire is contained ,
it does n't mean you ca n't be burned if you are n't careful .
a fire takes place at the local town .
the fire is very large and orange in color .
the fire gets larger and larger as it continues to burn .
the fire is spreading and someone needs to get it in control .
the cops arrive to instruct people to leave the scene and let the firefighters deal with it .
we headed down to check out the local beach .
it was complete deserted with people but there were plenty of birds
a lot of the seagulls were just relaxing in the water
there were a bunch more by the bridge and in the water .
it was just so nice and peaceful to be there with nature .
today was a great day for walking on the beach .
sun was out but not too hot .
walking the shore there was no one but me and hundreds of seagulls .
getting closer to the pier i could see signs of civilization .
but down here is nothing but peace and relaxation for me .
a look at the birds searching for food around the bridge .
birds flying above the ocean looking for fish .
rocks and sand in the ocean .
a good view of the bridge .
seagulls looking for fish to catch .
birds were feeding .
they flew off if anything else moved .
we hid behind the rocks to watch them .
but i slipped and they heard me .
they flew off but returned in just a few minutes .
when we got to the shore the tide was low .
we were disappointed the tide was so low when we arrived .
we were happy to come across this pier .
the pier reached quite far into the lake .
we decided to go up there and see what we could see .
i went for hike with my brother in location .
we cam across a beautiful shot of the lake just past all the trees .
this is my brother standing on the rocks near the lake .
we eventually made it donw to the beach where the water was pristine .
we posed for a shot in the palms later that day .
the beach was amazing
the jungle was gorgeous
the guys chilled out there
then went for a dip in the lagoon
they headed to shore when word of a sea monster was told
today the guys went out to the beach .
there was a bit of a hike but it was worth it in the end .
the beach was very natural and helped us feel at one with nature .
the sand felt great between our toes .
the best part of our day at the beach was the time we got to cultivate our relationships .
the guys found a trail to walk on .
then we found the coast .
the rocks were smooth .
the beach was beautiful .
we even took pictures next to some palms .
i was having a wonderful time enjoying the outdoors !
the scenery was beautiful and i was having so much fun !
after that , there was a wonderful beach scene !
the ocean looked and felt so peaceful .
the trees and shrubs were so vibrant !
the shopping district held a street party .
to find it just follow the row of stately palm trees .
take a right turn at the hotel with the stone balconies .
there it is ! music and dancing .
look at [male] showing off his dance moves .
this is where people come to have fun on vacation .
there are a lot of people that explore the area .
there is entertainment in the streets during the day and festivals .
the night life here is really fun . there are bands , clubbing and entertainment .
people dance and have fun at the club . this is a place where they can come and let loose .
some of my friends and i went on vacation in a tropical paradise .
the streets were lined with palm trees .
we loved seeing the buildings and the unfamiliar architecture .
some local residents were street performers , and they really made our day .
at night , we kept up the fun but tried to be respectful .
we went on vacation to another country .
there was so many out walking around .
we stopped to watch some street performers .
then we watched a stage show .
after that , we all danced to some music .
busy shopping tourists in location .
here a pretty street view . the building have so much character .
look at that detail on the balcony . such history in this building .
these street performers were great . they took her watch with out her even knowing .
party time ! i am going to regret those shots in the morning .
[female] is spending a day looking over the town where she grew up .
she takes off her sweater and walks on the beach .
the water was part of her growing up . here is the river before it empties into the sea .
she left these docks for boating more times than she could remember .
she ends the day by eating at the place where she was with her family every saturday night .
this is the city skyline of a big city with lots of culture .
there is a city skyline and still nature . the best of both worlds .
this man is visiting the city .
the sunsets here are very nice , calming and beautiful .
the environment and sunset are one of the reasons to go hiking in this area .
we took a vacation down to the beach .
the sand was so soft and white .
we walked down the boardwalks by the water .
then we saw a couple of piers over the water .
after that we stopped at a local restaurant to eat .
my husband took one photo on the first day of vacation and it 's a keeper .
our destinations always include water , we find it very relaxing .
on day three we walked for hours exploring the tourist spots .
we debated taking a boat tour , but it ended up raining .
this turned out to be a great spot to keep dry . the locals were very accommodating !
this lady is taking a trip for her honeymoon .
there were many beautiful areas including this beach .
unfortunately , it was extremely gloomy that day .
there was alot of open land and the sea was wide .
we ended up eating at a local restaurant .
graffiti is an art form . that has an amazing flexibility . some graffiti is a saying that the artist wants to say .
some graffiti is for beauty .
some graffiti is just for fun .
graffiti can ask existential questions .
it can also make political statement . graffiti is a true art form .
we took a stroll around town to look at all the graffiti .
we were tyring to decide if they were in fun .
or , if the graffiti was to make a political statement .
we were unsure what some of the artwork represented .
either way , there are many talented graffiti artists in this town .
our graffiti tour began with large , blue , intertwined letters that looked like the very epitome of 'bold statement ' .
our next stop was for something a bit more cute : a cartoon squirrel surrounded by equally cute , rounded letters .
the third stop of the day was more forward , with the drawing depicting a little girl saying to 'stick it to the man ' .
but not are always as straightforward , as our next destination showed a man with a camera for a head standing behind a woman , who was standing behind a somewhat square looking cat .
finally , to finish it off , we went to a bright red wall , a blue , scarred face in it 's foreground as ghostly faces seemed to float in the distance .
i walked around the city to look at all the artwork .
first i came across a woman 's face spray painted on the wall .
then i came to a cartoon squirrel .
after that i found all kinds of graffiti written on the wall .
finally i came to a political message on the wall .
there was alot of artwork on this street .
there were paintings of male and female characters .
there was also cartoon characters painted also .
this picture was of a symbol of some sort .
there were also paintings of different religious groups and beliefs .
i love the monkeys .
they were by my hotel .
so were these people .
the views were great .
but a little cloudy .
[male] parks his car and goes out to explore location .
he encounter monkeys everywhere .
he even sees a few elephants roaming about .
he heads up to the highest point of the village .
the view from here is amazing .
cars were a rare site on our trip to location but i did manage to see one .
we saw many monkeys playing around the village we trekked to .
the locals lived with elephants and they were considered part of the family .
the homes were a great contrast , some more modern looking and others looked like shack from before world war one .
you could n't beat the sight of the surrounding mountains though , especially in the mornings when it was covered in mist .
this is the rental car we used for our excursion .
we encountered monkeys .
we even saw an elephant in it 's natural environment .
the view of the village was beautiful in it 's own special way .
the mountain horizon was magical to see .
the monkeys were talking
near the wedding building .
where the ladies laughed
and looked at the mountains
that was covered in fog .
they were on vacation , and they first stopped at their hotel .
they looked out at the skyline .
another view from there place showed other houses in the distance .
the went into town and found it was busy .
they went back to there hotel , and had a hammock waiting for them .
we could not believe the beach view we had been blessed with at our home .
i continued to move through the home and it was more and more beautiful ...
and , then we reached the hammock , a surfer 's dream !
once i saw the home , i decided it was time to hit the waves ...
and , i surfed until the night sky moved in .
my father brought me out to one of his favorite places when he was younger . it was a small fishing village .
there , we stayed at a very quaint hostel .
it only had hammocks for bed but that was perfect for me .
he showed me the shop he use to visit while he was there and we rented surfboards .
we spent the rest of the trip surfing .
this was the view down the coastline from our bungalow .
relaxing in the bedroom in the bungalow .
instead of a couch , we had a hammock to relax on .
[male] showing off his large surf board .
[male] proving that he can actually surf .
the people were relaxing
before seeing the awesome sky
along the shore .
lots of people were coming
to lay in the hammock .
[male] went on vacation to a new city .
he went out to investigate his surroundings .
[male] had fun seeing the sights of the town .
he witnessed a beautiful sun set there .
when he got back to his hotel , he realized it was late and time for bed .
it was finally time to leave the drudgery of the office and take a vacation .
[male] was ready for his boating adventure .
he first had to motor past the skyline of the city .
then he went by the coastal mountains .
then , with the open sea in sight , he turned on the lights on the boat and pushed the throttle forward .
i sat and waited patiently to take my trip around the water .
i started the night with a walk .
first i got to see the city sky line .
then i came across a development area .
after the sun was setting , i saw a boat out in the water .
we are on our way to visit this city for a trip .
it was a beautiful sight all around .
here i am posing in front of a famous bridge .
we were here from morning til sunset .
we took many pictures including this one of different pictures and an antique clock .
we had to wake up early in order to catch the boat to the other side of location .
here 's location , looking sleepy as we climb the stairs to view the city .
our beautiful view from across the bay of the city .
looking in other directions , you could see the mountains and activity along the river .
we watched the sun rise from our vantage point on the hill . it was a great start to the day .
race day was off to a good start with more participants than we estimated .
walk or ride , so many of our friends and neighbors participated in this campaign .
everyone helped each other .
turn-out was unprecedented .
thank you to all of our participants .
marathon athletes train for iron man and similarly named competitions for long hours and some train early in the morning or late at night to be able to compete with the best in multiple stage events and those of us that are into this are dedicated to our passion .
the day of the race is a very exciting time for me and i love to size up the competition as they do equipment checks and the like .
the cycling portion of the race is my favorite part and it attracts some of the best athletes in the world so one has to be ready for the challenge because there are plenty to compete against .
family members and lovers of these competitions line the final stages of such events to cheer us on as we try to pull out a win in the end or for some just finish the race and i love the running part .
i do love these competitions but even if they stopped having them , i would still do it because it is my passion and especially cycling which is my favorite .
we watched runners and bicyclists in a race .
everyone was getting ready for the race .
the bicyclists was checking their bikes .
then when the race started everyone went as fast as they could .
some of the runners would wave at us .
the marathon runners were warming up .
people from all over were watching including people watching from their windows .
many of the bikers got their bikes prepared .
they biked across a long bridge in the city .
in the end , everyone was tired .
early start to the biathlon . nice and cool this morning should be great weather for the race .
first wave to hit the bikes . they wont be happy to the that huge up hill at the end .
so small they look like ants from this prospective .
the last of the runners are coming in now .
the winner finishing in strong with a great time .
the trek to location is hot and long .
after finding the right spot , the hike starts .
the sweltering heat makes the going tough .
the break in the dunes tells us that we are close .
and there it is , the salt flats . the place where speed records are broken .
we started our vacation in the mountains of location ...
which , also allowed us access to the salt flats below .
i told [male] , `` let 's jump in the vehicle and drive for a minute.. ''
we did and saw a beautiful mountain view .
[male] said , `` let 's take a picture . '' we did and then went back to the hotel to rest for the night .
the road seemed to go forever as my car broke down .
i started hiking back towards the nearest gas station . the ground was very sandy , which made it take longer .
the surrounding hills looked pretty desolate .
there were some shrubs along the way but they did n't help me with the heat .
for the most part , the land was completely flat . it took me a long time to get to the gas station .
it looks like big sky country .
the mountains , hill , valley , are amazing to look at .
i could look at this view of the mountains for hours .
the mountains look so far away .
the contrasting flat lands looks like a sea of sand .
the road was very long
and went by the mountains .
that had a little grass near them
and lots of sand .
it was a big desert .
at the end of the world , or so the group thought many escaped to the sea .
the group was not large but held together in hopes of rebuilding civilization .
they were stuck in the sea with only the clouds to entertain them .
until one day , they saw a flower on a small island .
they docked their boats and happily started to rebuild .
i saw some boats .
they were in the water .
i was cloudy .
but not too cloudy .
it was a great day .
one summer day we decided to visit the old harbor .
many people were already sailing out on the open water .
the weather was perfect , and the sky was gorgeous .
before boarding , i gathered some pretty flowers for my girlfriend .
we boarded the boat and set off on an adventure .
we decided to spend a day out on a boat .
there were several boats out in the calm water .
the sky was cloudy in a perfect way . not too hot for july .
there were beautifuls flower as part of our lunch table center piece .
i 'll never forget the day or the generosity of our hosts .
the ships are on the shore
and then they leave the dock
on the sunny day .
the flowers are blooming
when the ships come back .
i 've always dreamed of going to location .
my husband suprised me with a trip for our 25 wedding anniversary .
the ocean was so amazing , it looks so different on the location location .
i went for a run in the early morning when no one else was around .
the beauty and majesty of the beach was exilirating .
i love this photo from our vacation
the ocean was so beautiful
this is one of my favorite photos as the water splashes i snapped the photo
look how calm the ocean is in this photo
our last photo from the wonderful journey
the beach 's waves were sturdy .
the sky began to turn grey .
the waves made a big splash against the rocks .
it looked as though it was about to rain .
he walked on the beach after the water began to calm down .
the waves crashed against the island .
this island does not have any inhabitants .
the sounds of the waves was the only noise .
this island was a great place for the photographer .
getting pictures of the ocean was easy from his vantage point .
today was a great day to visit the water .
the water was nice and clam until..
a storm started coming in , then the waves started crashing against the rocks .
after the storm arrived the water calmed down again and we enjoyed the sound the rain made on the water .
the sky became blue and clear after the short summer storm passed .
the couple took their boat out on the lake .
they passed by water skiers .
the water was very calm on this day .
they stayed on the boat to watch the sunset .
at the end the docked the boat and covered it back up .
i love the lake .
the scenery was amazing .
look at all the trees .
the sun was going down .
and it gave me this gift .
the sun was still pretty high in the sky when i decided to hop in my boat .
i drove it around the local river , seeing water skiers along the way .
as the hours went by , the sun started to set and the land started to get really dark .
i saw that the sun was just about the disappear but it gave off such a beautiful glow .
i decided to stop my boat and just sat there , enjoying the view and contemplating life .
looking over the bow of the boat at the lake .
some jet skiers whipping around the lake .
the lake with no one on it , smooth glassy water .
sunset at the lake , nice and calm .
out boat settled in for the night while the sun sets .
the lake was calm for boating
and skiing as well .
the shadows were awesome
during the sunset
when the boating trip ended .
the waterfalls on our hiking tour were phenomenal .
we hiked up the long trail to reach it .
the trees were gorgeous on the trail .
on the other side an oasis awaited .
i could have sat here all day listening to nature .
the fields were beautiful of that day ,
full of lavender colored flowers ,
and lush trees . it gave shade and the breeze from the leaves were something to behold .
the waterfall cascading down the hill , was also beautiful to behold . it was something precious to enjoy .
i could feel the sand in my toes walking in the beach . i thank god for all his precious gifts .
our visit to location began with a visit to multnomah falls .
it 's one of the few year round falls in the state .
we then hiked in the surrounding forests before we drove 2 hours to the beach .
the beach was great because it was n't crowded . it was quite cold though .
we enjoyed how relaxing it was , just listening to the sound of the waves and gulls and having no one else around for miles .
it was suggested that we check out this waterfall on our trip .
i love the rumble of the rushing water .
i was fascinated with the unique moss growing on the trees .
just a short walk from the waterfalls was the beach .
we walked the beach for hours then sat on a blanket for a while .
the bridge was awesome
over the tall waterfall .
there was a lot to see
including the beaches
and the debris on the beach .
i took my family out to the lake last weekend .
we spotted this bird standing on a rock .
my dog got obsessed with the bird .
he sat there watching it until the sun went down .
after the sun went down , it was time to go back home .
the kids had a great time this summer .
we all visited a city .
there was a ton to do .
the kids like the lake best .
they left their mark in the sand .
we arrived at the beach as the sun was setting . we still decided to go play in the water .
while there , we saw a great heron standing on one of the rocks .
our dog wanted to go say hi to it but refused to go into the water .
it just sat there at the end , watching it .
the sky opened up eventually , giving a majestic view of the sunset as we settled down to watch it .
the kids and i went down to the shore .
this is our dog 's friend . we call him long neck . i do n't know what the dog calls him .
he and the dog have been friends for years .
they like to visit as often as possible .
they like to hang out on the pier together .
the girls were playing
near the big skyline .
there were many flowers
before going to the beach
and having a good time .
they had already been on the road for so long .
luckily they found a spot to get some breakfast .
after breakfast they went shopping .
the last stop they made in this town was to fill up the gas tank .
they left and continued on their road trip .
the car trip wore us out .
we made many road side stops to see the attractions .
of course we had to stop for organization organization .
a quick stop to gas up and we were back on the road .
the gas was priced much better this time than the last trip .
we decided to take a road trip with the kids .
we stopped at a location location .
we even visited the shops at [male] boone .
a short trip to the gas station .
then we turned around and went home . it really was n't all that fun .
they were resting for the long day ahead .
certain people must always be remembered .
it was time for a delicious meal .
the sign really stuck out in the night .
even the gas stations had creative names .
the adventure was great
and included a trip to waffle house
where a giant statue was .
the gas was cheap
and the cars were red .
we took a plane ride to our destination .
together , we took group pictures .
my husband and i had a really lively adventure .
we took pictures as an association .
the plane ride was cozy .
i thought my ipad would be useful on the flight ...
however , i was completely wrong . we arrived on time and the fun was ready to commence , just ask [female] ...
we had a drink before we left the airport ...
and , [male] and [female] took a moment for a photo shoot .
once we arrived downtown , [female] drank too much and went home with a local . i hope she remembers this tomorrow !
we all got in a bus and headed out on the road .
we stopped and had some laughs along the way .
we met a lot of cool people .
that first night we partied and had fun .
after we kept on going to our destination .
[female] making a funny face on the bus .
[female] waiting for dinner to get started .
[male] and [male] enjoying a before dinner drink .
[female] and [male] posing for a picture after dinner .
[female] and [male] snuggling before going to sleep .
the woman was very happy
that she had a goofy plush .
they were sharing drinks
and talking
before they hugged .
there were a few kids at the party earlier .
we were playing with chalk and some people got tagged .
we decided to take a group picture when the picnic was done .
my cousin and sister were both happy to be there .
the fireworks in the city that night were impressive .
our neighborhood likes to play games outside .
sides and teams are being picked . i hope to be on the winner .
is this turning into watching or is it about playing ?
finally , the ball comes out of hiding .
with the ball in the air , let the game begin !
the kids were dancing to the music .
the guys showed off their leg art work .
the family posed for a picture together .
the guy and his girlfriend took a picture together .

all the cousins were there .
we played a game of volleyball with a beach ball .
none of us did very well .
we are going to be having fun at a picnic today .
it looks like everyone is here so we can get going .
here we are with all of our friends .
i hope someone will be able to catch the ball .
ready or not here comes the ball .
we were excited to finally arrive at the airport in location .
one of the natives taught my son the importance of sunscreen upon arriving at the polynesian center .
the polynesians danced beautifully for the parade .
my sons especially enjoyed the waterfalls !
afterwards , we made our way to the beach and my sons had a great time with dad .
we took a family vacation to location .
the kids had a great time learning to fish on the pier .
the hula dancers put on a spectacular show for all the guests at the hotel .
afterwards , one of the dancers gave lessons to the guests on how to dance the hula .
the beaches were so beautiful and we enjoyed having fun in the water . it was one of the most memorable vacations ever .
when the family went on vacation , their first stop was a store . they were surprised to see a bird on display .
next they saw an island native getting ready for a show . he put a tattoo on the girl to show she was a member of his tribe .
then he danced for the tourists with other dancers .
after the show , the kids relaxed by a waterfall .
the day was complete when dad took the kids wading in the ocean .
the kids enjoyed looking at the parrot .
a friend covers the kid with sunscreen .
a tribe dances for the audience .
the kids sat in front of the waterfall .
lastly , we all took a trip to the beach .
the family took a trip to location .
they got some temporary tattoos .
then they watched some dancers perform by the water .
they found a small water fall close by .
after that they all took a trip to the beach .
along the beach , i found this bird and snapped a picture .
the tracks were nearby and i wanted to get a view of them too .
i walked back to the beach were the stones were .
from the stones , this green shrub was standing strong .
i thought this stone structure was just as interesting as the shrub .
a sign stands alone along this silent beach .
pavement along the walk way , going to our destination .
so any people have stood here , looking out over this vast distance .
something interesting we came along walking the beach .
through the trees , the beach stays the same after all these years .
the seagull perched on a log that looked like a beached sea monster .
we 'd taken an old train to get to the beach early that day .
there were mostly smooth stones along the shore .
on the ride to the beach , though , we 'd seen many interesting plants .
on the beach itself , some of the piles made us contemplate our existence and place in the universe .
i had a feeling this seagull was a very talented photographer , so i attached a camera to it 's face .
man was i right , seagull took this great picture of some train tracks by the beach .
seagull spent most of his time by the beach , but it took some great photos of the water .
this was one of the most interesting plants i 've seen , good thing seagull snapped a picture .
last of all was this great photo of some stacked rocks which seagull saw a great opportunity to practice his framing .
today we took a road trip across location .
we took highway 63 which was n't far from the beach .
we found some amazing overlooks that had a wonderful view .
we did stop to get a look at an old mile marker along the highway .
as the sun was setting we just watched the waves come in from the ocean .
lady taking pictures in the grass at night .
then she takes a picture with another female in a boat next to the ocean .
she takes another one next to a rock .
also another in the ocean , standing in the water .
then one final one in the sand .
this photo shoot was so much fun !
the models were excellent .
i loved the designer clothing we were trying to express .
the boat as a prop was super fun .
this dress in particular was my favorite .
havina is rocking a green top for her glamor shots .
jamille looks sexy in her yellow hood .
havina prefers wooded areas for her pictures . here she is in a formal look .
havina and jamille decide to take a photo together , since they are paying half each on the photo shoot .
one more picture of location by the ocean before we head back .
she never dreamed she would grow up to be a model .
a tall skinny kid everyone made fun of .
now she was considered a natural beauty .
she loved the camera .
and the camera loved her .
i hired some models to showcase my dress designs .
i 'm hoping to generate more traffic to my website .
the models did n't charge much , they know i 'm a recent graduate .
they were very impressed with my dress designs .
i 'm confident these photos will lead to some sales .
the fog rolls in on the location location .
like a cat it creeps up the bridge .
rising swiftly trying to get to the top .
it begins to swallow up the bridge .
and just like that ... it is gone .
on their way into town , some people saw a large amount of fog on the bridge .
from some angles , it appeared to engulf the entire structure .
even from far away , the dense ground cloud formation was visible .
it stayed for quite a while , despite it being an otherwise sunny day .
it was a weather phenomenon that few people get to see on such a beautiful day .
in location location for a lovely vacation and got a little extra .
the scary fog rolled in .
i thought it was a fire at first but the locals say this is normal fog .
i had to travel this bridge and was scared to death .
i got over it just fine and the fog melted away .
while out for my morning run i noticed that the fog was coming in over the location location bridge .
i decided to stay and watch the fog .
it was amazing how quickly it rolled in .
the fog became so thick around the bridge it was hard to tell it was there anymore .
i wonder what it would be like to be on the bridge , trying to look out through the fog .
the bridge was long
and had clouds around it .
it looked very cool
with all the mist
and clouds .
at sunrise , we awoke at our beach cottage .
we rode horses up the mountain .
the sunlight was beautiful coming through the trees .
we came across a lovely pond .
we were surprised to find that it opened up into a huge lake !
this is winter time in location .
the lake was starting to freeze .
the grass was dying and the trees were bare .
you can see a couple of people or animals swimming in the water .
there was some type of aircraft in the sky but it does n't appear to be a plane .
my day started at the shore but i was in the mood for a hike .
i ended up in a pasture a few miles away .
it was chilly but the sun was shining brightly .
spring took so long to get here .
some ice is still not completely gone .
on my day off i took a hike .
the water was partially frozen .
this tree looked barren but so beautiful .
i walked over to the ocean . there was a cool breeze but it was worth it to behold the beauty .
the sky turned a clear blue and this airplane made a neat trail through the sky .
sometimes there is nothing better than sitting outside and enjoying the sunset .
that 's especially after a long day of activities , including horseback riding .
we also hiked for about two hours through the woods .
the hiking was a little boring , but we did find some really interesting sites .
it was hot so i wanted to take a dip in the water , but was advised not to .
i recently discovered nagendra mayya photography .
it was perfect for purchasing pictures for travel articles i was writing .
the site has a lot of wonderful outdoor images .
the price per image is quite reasonable .
with so many beautiful ones to choose from , my job just got a lot easier .
you can see in the distance the hotel we stayed at for vacation .
which absolutely paled in comparison to the beach .
i could n't resist taking pictures of the scenery .
this beach was beautiful and secluded , but the stones forced one to wear shoes .
look at how lovely the sunset was !
we set out early in the morning for the island .
when we got there it was filled with white sand .
the beach was warm and sunny
as the day grew later it was time to go so we got back aboard the fairy .
the sunset over the ocean was beautiful on the ride home .
vacationing here is really awesome . beautiful sea water .
the beaches is beautiful also . breeze feels good .

an awesome look across the the midnight blue sky against the water .
the ocean was clear and calm .
the beach ahead was filled with people .
the shore had tiny pebbles on it .
[male] was waiting to get off the boat for his much needed shore leave .
but the weather was starting to turn .
it was a beautiful sunset at the beach today .
i had a great time .
there were many beautiful plants there as well .
we stayed until the sun completely set .
after it got dark we began the drive back home .
from sun up to sun down , these awesome scenic photos were taken .
this flower was absolutely stunning .
i just loved the canoes docked on the shore .
the sun set over the ocean is always my favorite .
this was a fun capture with the boat on the water .

i stayed out for the morning and captured some beautiful flowers as well .

the flowers on the beach were so fragrant and unusual .
my family and i went kayaking in the ocean .
i stayed up extra late to watch the sunset over the ocean .
and woke up extra early to watch the sun rise .
i decided to take many pictures together for my album .
i took pictures of many flowers .
i was also able to take pictures of the beautiful sky .
i was lucky enough to capture the giant sun .
i stayed there taking pictures from morning until night .
the animals on the asian beach is interesting .
there was monkeys too .
the bugs are very interesting .
the water is a nice attraction .
time to prepare dinner .

and a spider in its web .
for lunch went to a street vendor cooking meals for his customers .
our trip to location was simply amazing !
we saw some amazing animals .
the monkeys were my favorite .
some of the bugs were pretty crazy .
we enjoyed a traditional meal after our day spent outside .
we started by seeing the local wildlife .
the monkeys where everywhere .
after a few more pictures we moved on .
we saw the bay and got hungry .
so we stopped of at a local restaurant .
a trip to location offered all sorts of chances to experience local culture .
giraffes were available to view and they entertained all the spectators .
also native to the area were a species of red-faced monkeys .
spiders populated many of the nearby plants and wooded structures .
following an exploration of the area , local cuisine was sampled .
we had to pay close attention to the signs to get to our destination .
we spent about two hours driving on the road .
when we arrived at the beach , we noted the tide was a little high .
i got out to take a solo picture .
then i took a picture with my mentor on this amazing day .
taking off on our first vacation without any children . i finally get to go to the mountains .
we decided to take the long route to our cabin .
based on the signs ahead , i think we have gotten lost .
driving along the mountain is breathtaking , i hope we can find our way .
we finally made it to the cabin and the view from the back porch is absolutely amazing .
[male] and [male] were on a roadtrip .
the loved seeing all of the sprawling wilderness .
once they finally reached the coast they decided to go down to the beach .
[male] loved the ocean .
the pair decided they would go on another roadtrip as soon as they could .
we took a trip to the location location coast .
it was n't quite spring yet .
the wind was cold on the coastline .
the sky and waves were almost the same color .
we were the only ones on the beach .
we got in the car and headed out .
we hit the highway and drove for a while
we then found our exit .
we took the road a ways till we got to our destination .
going out to the mountains was worth it .
the photographers set off to walk the nature trail .
they took several photos of the plants .
along the way they climbed up a big rock .
the flowers in garden were in bloom .
they were excited to get a close up of a strange looking plant .
we went on a hike to get some nature pictures .
i made a remark about [male] being a professional photographer .
[male] , who is a professional photographer , took offense to that remark .
both of them climbed to some crazy places in order to get the shots they wanted .
all that climbing and they photographed rocks ?
we were on our way to find some rare flowers . some of us were not happy to be up so early .
others enjoyed it and was very happy .
along the way , we climbed some beautiful rock formations .
we found some common flowers but they were still beautiful .
we were finally rewarded with a rare plant after a few hours .
we headed out with our cameras to take some nature pictures .
we tool the trail toward the coast .
we came out at the coast and enjoyed the view .
in the bushes where some amazing flowers .
weird fungus grew throughout . it was an experience .
the guy was looking around
while they were taking photos .
the rock was giant
and the flowers were pretty
on this beautiful day .
they played frisbee on the field in the afternoon .
the weather started to turn which ended their outdoor games .
it snowed all the way down to the beach .
they went back into the cabin where they were staying to relax in front of a fire .
once the ice on the road started to melt they were able to continue their travels .
we threw the frisbee today .
i was throwing well .
[male] kept throwing it over me head .
i was throwing it strait to him .
every now and then he would throw one i could barely reach .
we were playing ultimate frisbee when the storm hit .
at first , it was just a light dusting of snow .
it picked up quickly though and soon the heavy winds blew the snow everywhere .
it covered the house and ground for the whole day and well into the night .
in the morning , the temperature rose a bit and it started to melt .
[female] making a daring catch on the trip .
the shore of the lake by the cabin we stayed in .
the tiny wave from the snowstorm .
this was one of the cabins we stayed at , small but nice .
the dirt road was the only way to the cabins .
the guy was running
before it started snowing .
the snow upset the water
and covered the houses
before the water calmed down again .
many tourists like to come to this area because of its natural beauty .
the area has nice looking green hills that would remind people of sound of music movie location . in addition , the area has very clean beach .
you may encounter wild mushrooms when you go hiking but you must be careful not to eat them since they could be poisonous .
people would usually spend hours walking and hiking .
at the end of their little adventure , tourists and local people would go to an ice cream parlor to treat themselves .
road trips are the best .
i sleep most of the time .
we pulled a trailer so i could rest better .
some of the group decided to walk .
we actually found what we had come for .
on our trip out to the country we saw many interesting things .
the cliffs and the seashore were breathtaking .
my sister found some interesting mushrooms , but we were afraid to pick any up .
she and i took a long hike along the cliffs . i was afraid to look down !
finally we came back to town and had ice cream sundaes to celebrate a perfect day .
the beach created a beautiful view .
some of us got pretty tired from the trip .
we made sure to get a car to fit everything we need .
the path kept us going in the right direction .
we stopped for a little snack too .
we went on a beach vacation !
though some of us had a hard time waking up .
but once we were all packed up and ready to go .
we had a fantastic adventure .
that ended with ice cream !
we went to the beach today .
there were a couple of birds in the sky .
more birds started to appear .
soon there were birds everywhere .
we think they all nest on this rock in the water .
she decided she needed to get away for the day .
a day out doors was just what she needed .
the beach was lovely and clear .
eventually she had to return home to the city .
the refreshing day off made her see things with more appreciation .
we decided to walk along the beach .
when we got there , birds where everywhere .
they where mostly diving and catching fish .
we cleared some space between us and the shore to get away from them all .
we then neared a large rock and kept toward it .
the family took a trip to the beach .
while there they saw some really interesting birds in the air .
the birds then landed in the water to looking for fish .
after they landed in the water , some of their friends showed up .
while looking at the birds they noticed a uniquely shaped rock .
the shore was calm
while the birds flew over .
the trees were very green
when more birds came
near the giant rock .
the scene was something to behold from my window .
the sunrise was glod and orange gave me feel relax and at piece with myself .
i could see from where [ was standing the small beach .
i went down to walk and get some fresh air and clear my mind .
i found the most unique building today it turns out to be a resturant .
the hotel was a nice get away but he wanted to go out .
the view of the beach was calling him .
he went to spend some relaxing time near the water .
he even found some informational signs about the area .
with so many places how would he decide which way to go ?
this is the lovely hotel we stayed in while vacationing .
this was the view we had from our balcony .
once we settled our belongings in our room , we took a stroll .
we had time before dinner to hit a few local attractions .
this one was my favorite . i had never seen such an elaborate home for goats .
here 's where we stayed on our vacation .
this is the view from our first floor balcony .
we went on a hike after we were directed to the best views .
my husband posed on shore where we rested for a bit .
we found a this unique structure by accident .
the hotel was very tall
along the beach .
the guy was looking at the rocks
and a map
near the big sign .
our house is the larger brick house , next to the white house .
the area where we live is near a lake .
this is the fence that acts as a guardrail , near our house .
the shallow mountains are located to the other side of the lake .
this is picture of my car , parked near our house , overlooking the lake .
my grandparents let me use their waterfront property for the weekend .
while many people my age might be throwing a party , i was excited just to get away from it all .
i enjoyed the breath taking views .
i communed with nature .
i reconnected with who i am and got a fair bit of writing done too .
my grandparents live in a house on a hill overlooking an inlet of the ocean .
their town sits right next to the water .
they have a nice lawn , which they pay a neighbor to maintain .
the best part is that they have spectacular views from their house .
we parked and sat for a while just to look out over the water .
we visited our friend that lives by the ocean .
the neighborhood he lives by is beautiful .
the ocean is so calm and blue .
then we stopped to look at the green trees by the water .
after that we took the car down to the water .
this house was put up for sale by the owner .
looking from the inside , you can see that there is a beautiful view .
you can see the vast mountains and see from the window .
there are also many trees around the area .
you 're also able to park by the grass area if you want to sit down .
location location location on a saturday morning was a great place for two fluffy dogs to cool down .
they found a nice shady place near the sand but not on the sand . so their coats stayed nice and clean .
the two found watching people very relaxing . they saw a dad with twin daughters taking a stroll .
they saw a man having trouble deciding which hanging candle holder suited him best . the dogs thought they looked all the same , because they see in black and white .
the dogs particularly enjoyed the street musician on roller blades , he could play his instrument , sing and skate fast . they appreciated the skill that took . after a nap the two dogs sauntered home .
this area is notorious for their scenery and beautiful leisure spots .
there is biking along the coast that you can participate in .
a lot of families come and spend their vacation .
the beaches are filled with people .
the little shops and tourist shops are packed and have great little food and markets .
the sign outside the location location pier just made us all the more excited to go inside .
it was n't only people who seemed to be enjoying themselves either , as we saw two dogs relaxing against some posts .
further on the beach , we even saw a man walking with his two twin daughters , both of them in matching dresses .
then it was time to buy some souvenirs , so we looked at some hanging candle shops .
we got a good laugh once we saw the 'no bicycles ' sign when we saw a man bending the rules in some roller skates .
we took a family to the location location location .
first we saw some dogs just enjoying the day .
dad took a walk with the twin girls .
then we saw street vendors selling artwork .

many people were out and about .
different families were out having fun and bonding .
there were also people selling items on the side of the street .
it was extremely sunny and hot that day .
this is the path that i usually take to go to the shopping center .
this is my neighbor and his daughter doing remodeling work .
this is a picture i that i 've attached to my wall .
there 's a lake near where i live , where we sometimes go to feed the duck or some catch fish .
this is the house where i live , taken during the winter time .
life has continued on it 's journey after your death . people still hustle and bustle .
mr. conche is trying to renovate his building , but i do n't think little [female] has much patience for that .
sylvio had a baby girl .
it seems only your mom has n't been the same .
and certainly not me . [female] misses her father .
in the olden days , people had to walk everywhere .
they also had to do a lot of manual labor ,
but they did get to enjoy the fruits of their labor .
many buildings were made out of stone and probably structurally unsafe ,
but they still enjoyed their lives and were none the wiser .
we took some pictures in our neighborhood .
the little girl watched her dad shovel rocks off the sidewalk .
then we came across a lady hold a baby .
after that we came to a woman in a black hat and coat .
at the end of the day it began to snow .
this country was extremely poor and old .
many people had lower end jobs including street cleaning .
this woman was on the streets without a home and only her newborn .
this woman is one of the luckier rich people in the area .
this is also another rich lady with her child enjoying the snow .
the dog was excited to be out of the house and hoped they would go somewhere in the car .
they did get in the car and he was so excited !
the first stop was to pick up some food to go .
he wondered as she ate on the beach if she would share .
would she ?
mac is my best friend .
he travels with me wherever i go .
he loves running on the beach .
we both sat listening to the sounds .
eating the lunch i packed for us .
this is [male] . he 's waiting for his human buddy to take him out on a trip .
he got in the car and waited patiently , excited to find out what the plans for the day were .
his human buddy parked the car and got out . a few minutes later she came back with a bag of food that smelled delicious .
his human buddy brought him and that bag of food to the beach and started eating . [male] stared at her , waiting patiently for his turn to get a bite .
he waited and waited , and waited some more . he stared in disbelief as she ate the very last bite . she had n't shared any of it . [male] realized that his human buddy was quite selfish .
i decided to take the dog out to the beach .
he got in the car and we drove there .
i let him out let him stretch his legs .
we had some food and enjoyed the day .
we finished up and left for our next destination .
the dog was curious
where they were going
when it noticed the sign
and wanted some food .
it was a curious dog .
the sun was very bright at high in the sky .
using the map , i found my way to the closest deck .
the deck gave me a new perspective of the water .
there were a few rocks and spots of grass and dirt .
regardless , i was able to enjoy my experience with a safe rail for my protection .
i 've just arrived at the ocean scenic viewpoint .
tourists observe wildlife from the deck .
pictures are carefully being taken .
the seals seem to be incredibly friendly .
the beach is alive with seals who are content in the mud .
[male] was enjoying his oceanside tour .
the tourgroup could smell the ocean .
they wondered why they could n't go out closer to the sea .
the manatees hung out on this beach .
[male] gave this manatee a nickname .
this is a picture of a sunny sky .
this is a picture of a sign .
this is a picture of a shore .
this is a picture of the ocean .
this is a picture of the bridge .
we went to the alaskan coast on vacation .
even in summer it was a bit cold .
we watched the sea lions .
they would sunbath on the beach .
a couple of them noticed us watching .
we went on a family vacation this weekend .
it was on a beach and it was beautiful weather that day .
there was even some grilling and great food .
we relaxed that night at my home .
we even saw a rainbow to end the beautiful day with .
[male] and [female] love hanging with their friends .
[male] and his brother are best friends .
same and [female] get along great with her sisters as well .
[male] and [male] relaxed by the ocean on the beach .
the end of this wonderful day was a rainbow .
the group of friends decided to get together for a vacation of fun in the sun .
there were tropical drinks and sandy beaches .
they could n't help but have an amazing time .
they even had picnics out on the beach .
a rainbow symbolized the perfect end to the perfect trip .
the weather today was great !
we lined up to try the food .
the barbecue came out really well .
puppy had a long day .
at the end , we saw a rainbow .
our family reunion was so fun .
the guys had a good time bonding .
we snapped lots of pictures together .
the beach is where we spent the afternoons .
this rainbow seemed to greet us .
her parents took her on vacation for her birthday .
she was excited to see the dolphins .
the biggest surprise was when she was able to go swimming with them .
she had a lot of fun bonding with them .
at the end of it all though she was happy to be home and reunited with her cat .
welcome to sea world , the home of the twin dolphins , among other things .
if you choose to swim with the dolphins you wo n't regret it , just do n't be afraid of them and they wo n't be afraid of you .
remember to pet them very gently , so they get a chance to warm up to you .
our newest addition of wildlife are our fabulous exotic parrots - [female] want a cracker ?
beep , beep , beep , got to keep moving along .
took my daughter on a trip to the location location .
she insisted on seeing the dolphins at a water park .
for only a small fee , she was able to pet the dolphins .
they seemed to like her too , and came over to rest their chins on her arms .
despite the fine time with the sea creatures , she was very happy to come back to her cat clancy .
before heading to our destination we were able to view the beautiful city .
when we got to the aquarium the dolphins were ready to put on a show .
mom let me swim with the dolphins .
they were the most beautiful creatures i have ever seen .
but getting back home to my pet cat was the highlight of my day .
went to the seaside animal show today . these are friendly dolphins .
i even got to ride one . it was fun .
they did a demonstration of where to hold on to the dolphin so he will pull you .
this was a funny parrot , he can roller skate and do tricks .
here is one of them , he 's riding a motorcycle .
it was a day to enjoy the sea .
many others had the same idea .
every bend had something new to explore .
even the dogs got involved .
the sunset capped the day off nicely .
my daughter and i came to watch the sailboat races .
the masts are tall and have long sails .
photographers gather to capture the views .
the race has begun , and the sailboats are taking up a mild wind .
it 's a matter of which team will master the elements to win the competition .
it was her first time visiting a beach .
the pirate ships sailing past us kept her occupied the entire time .
she was so excited to see the large ships .
now she thinks every time we go to the beach , she 'll see pirates .
that fact gets me a little worried .
the location location location is a 50 berth public marina and located in location .
the marina is an integral feature of the luxurious and exclusive senibong cove homes .
it is nestled in a safe , protected basin at the mouth organization organization .
a cruise in these parts will yield a lot of stunning visuals - including this funny one .
who will not be willing to part with a million bucks for this titanic-like visual of the starboard ?
the day was beautiful so the family took the dog and went to the water for the day .
they saw the old boats out on the water and wished they could get on one .
they went along the shore in search of shells .
they threw the toy for the dog into the water so he could swim for while .
they all sat together and enjoyed the sunset after a great family day .
my girl here decided we should go on a trip so we piled in the car and away we went .
along the way we snapped picture after picture because we fancy ourselves as photographers and also because we were bored from what you are seeing in this picture .
it was a very long drive and she started taking pictures of what looks like a pasture of cows so i started taking a picture of her taking a picture of a pasture of cows so that tells you how the trip is going .
we finally see some buildings and some people that have fanny packs on turned toward the front with what looks like cameras like us so right away i knew we had to be looking at tourists so i took a picture because that is just how i am .
finally we saw some water and wide open spaces so we got out of our transport vehicle and walked toward the water , stayed a while , took some pictures and then walked back with this last shot being taken before going home with our trip done .
time for a road trip .
i do n't even know if i can pronounce the place i 'm going .
we hit the road in my little high mpg car .
finally , we made it to the beach .
there were para-sailors there when we arrived .
the roadtrip had taken 12 hours .
the group was driving out to stay by the ocean
they could n't wait to get out of their car to strech their muscles .
once they got to the sea they knew the drive was worth it .
the salty air was refreshing after such a long drive .
so happy to be getting on the bus for our tour of the countryside .
first we spotted a beautiful tree grove to one side of the bus .
next we spotted some cows in the distance .
there is a couple of tourists taking photos of some country homes .
and some people having fun in the wildflowers leading down to the water .
this is what the road looked like in our travels .
we were inspired by the brochure to travel .
this is one of the cars we have seen on the road .
the weather was not perfect for the occasion .
however , we saw this person paragliding .
location location is a very lovely place to visit this time of year , while everything is so green and the students are n't out of school yet .
i 'm sure you 'll find the architecture to be quite interesting .
the shorelines here are calm and serene , surrounded by lush green mountains .
in this closeup of the mountains , you can see how dense and fertile the grass is .
do n't forget to visit the museum , located near the beach entrance .
i 've always been a world war ii buff , so when the opportunity to visit location and see where d-day took place came up , i jumped on it .
i stared at the trees as we drove there , thinking about what they might have been witness to on that day , more than a half-century ago .
when we arrived , there was a sign that noted where we stood .
the beach looked so serene to me . i could n't imagine this being the place where so much death and destruction took place .
as one final leg of the trip , i went to see the location 's memorial cemetery . it was so moving to see all of those crosses standing .
as i approached the beach , i noticed the sign at the entrance .
the first monument i came across was the pyramid shape .
the beach was very beautiful and rather empty considering the time of day .
back from the beach , the grassy field was equally impressive .
through my tour of the beach , i also saw this wonderful monument surrounded by pillars .
the sign was prepared so that i could see the information .
there was an interesting pyramid outside the resort .
the beach was moist by the shoreline .
there was a lovely beach and i could see the waters .
the statue in front was brilliant and i respected it .
she decided to spend the day at location location .
there were some very interesting sculptures .
she walked along the beach for quite a while and found long stretches with seashells along the edge .
the grass near the beach was very lush and green .
she spent some time at one final sculpture area before she headed home .
we went to travel to another country to sightsee .
first we went to a museum .
then we went on a boat ride to smell the fresh air .
we even went horseriding at the beach .
then we ended the night with beautiful fireworks .
going horse bike riding on the beach .
going on top of the hill .
looking at the waves crashing on the sand .
standing on top a roof .
watching the sun setting .
here 's the street where we stayed during our visit .
we stopped by the local store and viewed the collectibles .
the boats passed through the dock .
horses on the beach .
fireworks in the night sky .
its always nice to go horseback riding on th3 beach .
there are very few people on the beach today .
the waves are getting more aggressive as the night comes .
all the greenery is gone .
all you see are hills and mountains from here .
i could n't help but giggle at this .
i went to a museum .
i took a boat cruise in the evening .
i also took a horseback riding trip .
i came back in time for the fireworks .
we did not see many seagulls when we went to the beach , just one or two .
this is a photograph of my friend , standing by the sea .
there was a small number of houses along the beach .
this is the sidewalk we took , after walking on the beach , to go to a restaurant .
this is the bridge we had to cross to get to the sea side .
i went to the beach in the morning yesterday .
about noon , the tide started to go out .
after the tide went out , it exposed interesting shapes in the sand .
i could n't believe how far the water moved away from the beach .
a few hours later , the water started to return to the beach .
i took at trip to the beach today .
the day was so beautiful to go for a walk .
then i noticed the wind was blowing the water pretty hard .
after that , i saw that i was alone on the beach .
i stayed and watch the sun go down .
there is something very restoring about a walk on the beach .
the rippled sand is endlessly fascinating to me .
i look out as the water hits the sane and truly relax .
i love the open expanses .
the light hitting the water is a new piece of artwork every minute . i need my beach walks to survive .
stroll at the beach before we head to the airport .
the tide coming in . so sad vacation is ending .
last view of the beach houses here in the keys .
soon we will be back to reality . next trip back cant come fast enough .
well at least the traffic was n't bad .
i brought my son to the beach .
my wife just watched and smiled .
i played football with my son to keep him active .
on our way home , he told his friends he had a great time .
before we got home , we stopped to honor the flag .
as soon as we got to the beach the kids went straight to play in the water .
looking around there was a fair number of people at the beach , but not too crowded .
he claims he got stung on the foot by a jelly fish but i think he is making it up for attention .
it is important to stay hydrated when playing in the sun all day .
the surrounding landscape was beautiful , i wish i owned one of those boats !
the immigrant boy looked mean and angry .
his mom , sitting comfortably on the beach , told him to just chill out .
his father took no notice , instead playing throw with someone else 's child .
unobserved , a mysterious man checked his phone .
old glory waved in the wind ; it was going to be a 4th no one would ever forget .
we brought our son to the beach last sunday only to have him challenge everyone around to a fight to the death .
luckly for them , nobody came to meet their maker .
i once broke my foot after trying to meet my son 's challenge , but the scars have healed well .
he usually stays so hydrated at the beach , which makes him even more of an unstoppable force of nature .
after i took that last photo , he took my camera and threw it into the air , only to have it take a perfect aerial photo of a nearby park .
today we took a family vacation to the beach and had so much fun .
mom managed to get some sun sitting on the beach .
dad decided to throw a football around on the beach .
our cell phones did n't have any reception on the beach .
today was such a beautiful day to be outside .
i went to the beach with my brother yesterday .
it was a wonderfully comfortable day where the temperatures were great .
we met up with some more friends and decieded to do some candid shots .
this was my favoraite shot , it was tough to get everyone in the air .
just as the sun set we all took one last swim in the great water .
my friends and i went to the beach yesterday .
the guys were acting crazy and i got a picture of them .
the water was cold but felt good because the weather was so hot .
my boyfriend and i needed this time away from work and obligations .
the gorgeous sunset was the best ending to a great day !
we took the boys to the beach for the day .
i asked them why they did n't go in the ocean . they replied `` we never go in until the sun sets ! ''
here they are waiting for the sun to set . the boys started to get rambunctious .
another jump photo , [male] in the back was doing flips !
finally the sun set and the boys ran into the water . so silly .
me and my friends went out to the beach .
we hung out and enjoyed the waves .
then we tried to get a good beach jump pick .
then we finally nailed it .
we jumped in the water and watched the sun go down .
we had a blast at the beach
some guys just hung out on the sand
we had so much fun taking pictures
this was a favorite of mine of us jumping
the sun set was incredible
from afar , we could only see a small white spec on the ice .
when we zoomed in , we were able to see the small bird .
his friend was a bit darker than him but they still got along .
the birds all grouped together and flew .
when they were done , they ate and rested .
we went to the park to feed the ducks and birds .
we ran into this cool looking duck , he followed us around the whole day !
the birds were fighting over each scrap of bread .
it was really cold , so they must have been really looking for food .
after we left , they were all full and happy . i think we 'll return soon to feed them .
saw this duck as i was walking home from the beach .
he actually let me take a close up .
seagulls scouting for food .
i think they found something .
dancing birds , what a treat .
this little guy was so light he could walk on the thin ice .
i had to get a picture though the ice was thicker than i thought .
this one was n't afraid of people at all .
these birds dove in eagerly for food .
it was a very fun day of watching nature .
we went by a local pond to feed the ducks today .
we saw many different kinds of ducks .
there were even seagulls around .
the seagulls were trying to eat all the food .
we saw a weirdly shaped sea creature also .
we went out for a walk and saw some amazing things .
there was an incredible eagle out on this ledge .
there was a family of ducks by the frozen lake .
we went by the bridge and looked out over the frozen lake .
it was such a beautiful calm day , one that i will always remember
we took a long drive on a sunny , winter day , and saw this bird just chilling in the snow .
the ducks found a place to swim in the midst of a snowy field .
the sun broke through the clouds showing the magnificence of this winter wonderland .
the ducks left their swimming hole in search for more duck friends .
this gorgeous expanse of snow reminded us that even winter days could be full of joy and beauty .
went outside in the snow and noticed a hawk .
he was perched up on a small tower .
then i walked around the lake .
it was completely frozen over .
i had never seen anything like that before .
[male] the falcon wanted to go on a trip .
he was so sick of his industrial grid . he wanted to see the world !
he flew around a lake area on a cold winter morning .
the sun was shining outside .
he flew all over . it was a beautiful day .
as the hawk sits out and surveys the land , he notices something .
in the far distance , he looks , and then begins to fly .
he flies all the way to the bridge , but could n't find what he was looking for .
in the distance he thinks he sees it again and begins to fly off .
but even still , he is unable to find anymore hawks anywhere .
we had a romantic dinner outside of the beach house .
this was one of the most relaxing vacations we have taken .
we walked down to the beach to enjoy the sunset together .
the sun started setting as the waves crashed against the rocks .
i glanced up and noticed a small family enjoying the sunset as well .
we went on vacation last weekend .
we stayed along the coast .
the view was beautiful there .
i had a great time .
it was a lot of fun .
[male] and i set out to find an adventure by the sea .
and we found it . the landscape was beautiful . building a house right here would be awesome .
look how serene that [male] looks . he is so beautiful too .
when the waves were starting to crash on the rocks it looked like something out of a movie ,
here i am , standing on a bluff and enjoying all that god has made . what a beautiful trip this turned out to be .
went up to location location for a fun in the sun getaway with my boyfriend .
here 's me , i am so excited to go out to the water .
here we are so happy together .
there we will be soon , we got ta hike down to that .
soon , we will be where they are but i had to take this beautiful picture .
my wife and i honeymooned at this beautiful cabin last october .
we had our own deck attached to our room .
we could see the ocean from the deck .
in the morning the water would be choppy .
but at night the water was smooth so we 'd go for a hike to catch the sunset .
this view of the beach should certainly be on a postcard .
this rock just seems to represent peace and serenity .
the sea is so calm , it seems the sand is blended in with the water
the ocean is the perfect back drop for this photograph .
i was so astonished to see that i caught the tail of a seal with my camera .
look how large this rock is in the ocean .
i zoomed in , i wonder how it got there .
the birds were hungry today .
i bet it is going to storm soon . the wind is blowing hard .
i thought this statute was very interesting . i sure like whales .
went to the beach to take some photography pictures .
this outcrop looks so intriguing in the water .
there were lots of little birds on the shore as well .
the vegetation is so fragile near beaches .
this abandoned statue was really neat to snag a few pictures of .
i went on a trip to the shore .
this rock dominated the shore .
the water was calm and the tide was low .
these weeds looked simple but beautiful against the water .
this fish statue symbolized one of the types of fish that can be found in the area .
the rock formation was very large
in the water .
the beach was clear
and there was grass
by the big whale statue .
we went out for a stroll and encountered a flock of geese who forgot to fly south .
i wanted to take some scenery shots of this place at dusk .
this is my favorite place to stop on our evening strolls .
another shot of the out of place geese and the huge sundial .
last shot before we took cover from another snow storm .
i had a great time at the canal today .
it was partially frozen this time of the year .
it was very cold .
many of the ducks were there .
there were some colorful lights at night .
we started seeing the birds by the fountain .
we walked around the bay getting pictures for awhile .
the huts out there where really cool .
the whole area was very exotic at times .
we got a few more shots and headed into town .
i traveled to location last winter .
the nights were beautiful and green with the northern lights .
there was a lot of cool outdoor architecture .
the snow covered the ground everywhere .
there were also shooting stars destroying the town .
i played around with the filters on my phone .
the colors in this scene made the landscape look gorgeous .
i stopped in this pagoda and took a rest .
snow covered the land and made it look magical .
the snow started falling again as i was snapping this picture .
the frozen lake is beautiful .
the snow glistens in the snow .
the house is small but warm .
it is cold outside for this man ,
the tree is stunning in the morning sun .
it was very cold at the beach today .
the weather was good .
there was no one else there .
it was cold but the water was not frozen .
we played for a couple of hours .
i vacationed on the beach in location last summer .
the sand was covered in snow .
i stayed in this tiny cabin on the beach .
every morning i 'd go for a walk along the water .
my favorite location to walk to was this giant dead tree .
the lake was frozen .
steam puffed out of the old factory .
he did n't know where he 'd find work in this weather .
ground was frozen hard as a rock .
on the bright side , at least he could spend time with his dog .
believe it or not the sun really does shine in location .
additionally , people really do work in location .
granted , we do spend a lot of our time in isolation in the snow .
i actually walk my dog through the snow almost every day .
location is not the warmest or most active place , but i still love it .
the couple was taking a walk on the beach .
they saw some interesting things from nature .
the trails of foot prints were all over .
there was a lot of liter .
it was all over the beach .
have you ever noticed how many interesting items you cab find lying around at the beach ?
i went for a walk this morning and do n't even know what some of the things i saw are .
i 'm sure there 's an interesting story behind this .
whatever this was , it 's now old and rusty .
one of my favorite finds was this feather . it 's so delicate . it was quite an interesting walk .
the beach has become littered with trash .
the feather of what was a bird left in the sand .
the group walked thru the sand seeing all mess that was left .
a rope left in the sand what was it used for ?
another piece to pick up that was left behind .
this is a picture of a bottle .
this is a picture of a feather .
this is a picture of footprints .
this is a picture of a rope .
this is a picture of a hat .
we eagerly waited for the chance to pick seashells from the beach .
dad and i wondered what type of bird the feather came from as we looked at the feather .
we had fun making footprints in the sand .
the children started in disbelief both afraid and enchanted at the site .
we wondered if the trap was set on purpose to gather seafood for dinner .
we went on a nature sight seeing trip on vacation .
we ended up on the beach , it was deserted and felt like it was our private beach .
the skies were blue and perfect .
we visited a local waterfall and swam in the pond .
later at night we relaxed while the sun set in the forest with nice views .
a group of friends decided to tour the location in an rv .
they went to location location .
they visited location location .
they also went to location .
each night they would discuss the place they visited and enjoy each other 's company .
we had some refreshments before our beach trip .
the beach was beautiful today lots of sunshine .
i got this picture of [male] at the waterfalls .
it was lots of fun to check out the shops at the beach town .
the ladies enjoyed some good conversation during our trip .
it was their first day at the beach , of the couples honeymoon .
making their way down to the water , they carried all their beach gear .
it was a perfect first day there !
after laying out a bit they began to explore and found a cool waterfall .
it was there they enjoyed the first sunset of their vacation .
we went on an amazing vacation
we went to the beach
it was just beautiful
there was a waterfall
sunrise every morning was special
the sun was shining bright on this hot day in july
the city of location beach was a busy place as usual .
planes flew high over the ocean , this one stood out because of it 's bright color .
sometimes beautiful birds are walking across , and if timed right you can catch a picture .
but it 's when they turn around to look at you that you know the picture will be perfect .
we decided to spend the day at location location .
it was beautiful weather !
we rented some surf boards .
the waves were great !
the drive home was lovely .
a good view of the life guard seat .
lovely view of the ocean with the clouds .
getting fishing rods to go fishing .
my boyfriend out in the ocean surfing .
a good view of the dock and the mountains behind it .
we got to the beach around morning .
we found a good spot near the life guard tower .
planes where flying above us as we relaxed .
a little bird came and tried to get food from me .
if you feed one , more always come .
a group of friends visits location location .
the beach is empty and gorgeous .
it is somewhat cold people wont be swimming today just fishing .
the ocean is rough and has white caps while the surfer surfs the ocean .
the boardwalk leading over the ocean is gorgeous and made of wood .
i was trying to figure out which house to buy .
there were so many good options .
i checked all around the neighborhood .
only a couple of them were in my price range .
that made the decision easier .
today , i went on tour of historic homes in my hometown . it actually was pretty interesting .
most of the homes were built in the 1800s . i ca n't imagine living in home that old .
some of the homes looked like castles , whereas other homes looked more ordinary .
some of the homes had been split over the years . the split homes had been used for rentals .
some of the homes were in the busy parts of the town , whereas others were isolated apart from town .
we saw many houses on the block .
one house was a cute yellow one .
then we saw some big brick houses .
they looked old and sturdy .
the architecture reminded me of colonial times .
while looking for a new house we visited many neighborhoods .
this one was one of our favorites because of how spacious it was .
we really enjoyed the architecture of this house , but it was a little too expensive for us .
this house had a great location and was in the heart of the city .
we finally decided on this house , which was the perfect blend of size and looks .
the couple was looking to buy their first house , their realtor showed them a huge house first .
but that was way too big for them , so they moved on to a smaller home .
all the homes they saw seemed to have something wrong with them .
or they just did n't feel right .
until they came upon one house , and from the moment they saw it , they fell in love . this was it !
we went walking on the beach , hoping to find sea shells .
[male] looked great in his jacket and the water crashing behind him .
we found a hermit crab burrowing in the sand .
and , some cute surfer boys for us to oogle .
and , we ended the day with a great shot of [male] on the steps .
looking for rocks on the sand .
found a few colorful rocks .
looking at surfers about to surf .
all of the surfers are catching waves .
impressed by their performance .
[male] liked being at the beach .
he liked the sand on his feet .
he stepped on this mollusk .
he likes watching the surfers .
overall , [male] had a good day at the beach .
i spent hours on the beach today .
i had a great time .
there were plenty of things to see .
i collected a lot of seashells .
there were n't many other people there .
the man was looking for interesting sea shells on the shore .
he found some colorful rocks during his search .
he also saw some friendly surfers trying to catch some waves .
here are the surfers riding waves with great skill .
the man was content with his day at the beach .
the team is ready for the big game .

at the park , there were signs highlighting the trails that visitors could hike .
during the time of year of the visit , trees were turning into their fall colors .
the park is a good location to watch birds , including the raptor photographed .
a local cat also enjoyed bird watching at the park .
birds tend to thrive on the island ...
however , they are injured from time to time by the sea otters .
that is when the bird rescue team comes into play .
they are constantly helping with the animals ...
like these baby ducklings .
i went to the beach last week .
there were a lot of wildlife there .
many seals were there .
they were hanging out .
there were also a lot of birds .
i had a fun day on the lake . i saw a lot of animals .
birds were walking all over the place .
otters were scurrying around .
this one kept hissing at a bird in the water .
the bird eventually flew away angry .
a wildlife rescue team arrives at the beach .
they see animals suffering from an oil spill .
they get out their equipment to help and observe .
they observe many birds they could help .
it looks like the birds observe them too .
perched on the old sign it sat in silence .
watching the seals .
the rescue workers .
the oil spill had killed so many .
at least these ducks were saved .
the remained calm as the sun started to set .
in the distance i could see a family enjoying the view .
the waves began to get more aggressive as i walked along the shore .
i made my way to the rocky sea side where the waves were less aggressive .
here i watched the sunset over the sea .
we enjoyed our afternoon on the beach .
the waves sounded beautiful crashing on the shore .
the sun slowly made its way down the horizon .
the sunset was gorgeous .
we stayed a few hours into the evening .
i love sunsets ! there never seems to be one sunset that looks like the other .
my family and i like to go out in the evening and watch the sun go down behind the ocean .
peaceful and calming sense of how the sounds make you feel .
water crashing on the rocks , or the birds making their way from way place to the next .
be grateful you have your eye sight to see such wonderful things.we take so much for granted .
i went for a walk last weekend .
i decided to head down to the beach .
there was a beautiful sunset out on the horizon .
i had a great time .
afterward i headed back home .
we started off our beach vacation by getting a great spot to watch the sunset .
we set out a comfortable blanket . we brought along a picnic basket with wine , cheese and crackers .
we snacked on our food and sipped our wine while watching the sun begin to set in the sky .
the waves crashed on the rocks below us . i got some great pics of the sunset !
we enjoyed the beautiful sunset while we drank and snacked . we planned our days ahead for our fun beach vacation .
we like to take a weekend trip to stay at the hotel aboard the [female] [female] .
we like to stroll the beach and feed the birds .
the water is always so beautiful .
it 's perfect for a swim .
every time we come it is like our honeymoon .
i love to travel .
this place is amazing .
there 's so much to see .
so much to do .
i must go back soon .
our anniversary was spent by the docks . we started out by this huge boat .
digging our feet into the sand was nice . these birds decided to join us .
here 's the water from above . it looked way too cold to go in .
the beach was empty . i was flabbergasted .
i love my husband . it was a great day at the pier .
it 's our yearly vacation , and we decided to spend as much time as possible around the beach and the ocean .
on the pier , there was a beautiful view and a fresh breeze .
it got a little crowded though , so we decided to head back down to the shore .
we loved watching the waves roll in and feeling them on our feet .
then , some visitors arrived . we fed them some bread and watched them fly around before heading back inside for lunch .
we could n't hop off the cruise ship quick enough .
the beach was right there for us to use .
and , [male] was ecstatic to take a swim .
we then walked the beach for hours ...
and , we found a pier to take a beautiful picture .
[female] was determined to have a good day on the beach .
so [female] took her daughter [female] out for a day of fun in the sun .
[female] 's sister jen played with [female] as they both laid out on the deck leading to the beach .
after a fun time with [female] [female] took a break to look back at the ocean and all of its beauty .
once the sun started going down it was time to head home , but one last look was always the best .
my friends and i decided it would be cool to take a walk in the woods nearby our town .
we walked along the random pathways and looked at all the wonderous nature surrounding us .
my friend [male] urged us to go further down this particular path because he had heard that there was something at the end of it .
the path kind of disappeared under our feet and we kept walking through the dense vegetation .
it was totally worth it because [male] thought he hear water and he was right ! we cooled off from our long nature walk .
[female] was the love of my life .
one of the two loves of my life , our daughter [female] , was the other .
we loved to play together in our bungalo .
[female] never looked better than standing out by the ocean .
i had a the perfect life .
the family was having fun on vacation .
the baby had never been on vacation before .
she loved her mom and sister .
the sister went out onto the beach .
everyone was glad to be on vacation .
i have the most beautiful wife in the world .
she recently blessed me by giving birth to our first child .
i thought having a daughter might be a little bit of a burden but i ca n't get enough of her .
i still ca n't get away from my wife either , and recently took her on a lovely tropical vacation .
i have to admit that i enjoyed the peace .
we had a great day walking down the shore .
colorful boats sat at the dock .
street vendors sold beautiful artwork .
many others like ourselves , just enjoyed the sites .
a nearby park gave us place to rest at the end of the day .
the streets are lined with people .
we are at a small port for local boats .
people are selling their wares all along the way .
this is a place of gathering for locals to talk and play games .
there are also tourists here to take in the peaceful waters .
there was an art fair but the water today .
the boats were docked by newcomers and visitors .
a jewelry maker had a field of her goods .
some locals were playing a dice game in the sand .
tourists watched down at them , marveling as the locals seemed to not have a care in the world .
first we went to the port .
there many artists were selling their creations .
they sold beautiful artwork along the streets .
people often went there to watch the boats unload .
sometimes we could see smoke coming out of the next building , this was not one of those times .
this is the last time we take a bargain cruise !
i can not even tell you where we landed .
the sightseeing left a lot to be desired .
i was all too eager to board the ship again .
the last thing i saw as we left the dock was a lonely bench . it seemed to be screaming to me , `` take me with you ! '' sorry , bench , you 're on your own .
when i arrived my friends pretended they were being rescued by me .
was n't long before [male] was lounging with a beer .
we got some good fun in the water swimming .
[male] was still drinking and lounging .
[male] got some fun shots of his girlfriend , everyone had a great time .
a couple went to the beach together .
their friend was a third wheel .
they had a photographer there to take photos of them .
they brought a raft to go out in the water on .
their friend remained alone under the shade .
we 're here . this little boat survived bringing all of us .
how long do i have to stay this way . i heard that picture snap a million times .
wonderful day for a beach shoot . i love my job .
what do you think of this pose ? i do n't think it will work .
i could be here all day getting my picture taken .
a day at the beach our inflatable boat awaits .
i tried to stay cool in the water .
my friend waded in the shallow water .
the cabana was behind me .
a pretty girl modeled for the camera man
everyone was excited when we landed at the beach .
[male] was having fun relaxing near the water .
[female] and [male] were swimming out in the crystal clear water .
[female] and [male] decided to relax in the shade but [male] did n't mind the sun .
we had a great time at the beach that day .
day 1 of the alaskan photography expedition .
day 2 visiting the penguin reef , no penguins in sight .
day 3 , a wonderful adventure to visit live active volcano 's .
morning day 4 , sight seen while the photography club was going over the days logs .
last day of the trip . this photo ranked 1 from our photography guide .
i love to visit any body of water there are sandy beaches .
also rocky beaches .
some beaches are surrounded by greenery .
others are surrounded by weeds .
but the most beautiful is the one with the mountain view .
i went to the beach last weekend .
i could see some boats out on the ocean .
there were some mountains in the distance .
i had a great time there .
i felt like going hiking on those mountains .
a nice sunny day in next to the water .
the shore was beautiful but foreboding .
not much grows near the water .
looking across the bay the sun shown in the daylight .
snow capped mountains made you understand how cold it was there .
i went to visit a lake on the weekend .
the landscape had a lot of rocks on it .
there were also lots of green areas .
these plants delicately lined the shore .
there were snow capped mountains in the distance that i hope i can climb one day .
i went down to the water earlier .
i met a raccoon along the way .
there were some birds flying overhead .
i had a great time there .
it was very beautiful .
the sunset was so beautiful , that i stayed long after the sun had set .
this was the largest she 'll that i had ever seem in my life .
i was shocked that this raccoon sat still for me to take a picture without attacking me , or moving .
this eagle soared high , and just looked to transcend the air we breathe .
this shell seemed to be there for a very long time , and i plan to keep it that way .
is that a sea urchin ?
who knows ? i was distracted by a raccoon .
and then this pretty bird .
it made me think how neat it would be to fly .
i wish i was a bird .
looking in the water i come across this thing . i do not know what it is .
i do know this is a raccoon and they love to dig in your foods .
spotted an eagle flying free .
i 'm lucky to get these pictures they are hard to take .
one last one before it flies off .
the ocean is awakening for the day .
in a nearby grassy patch , a young raccoon awakes .
birds begin to fly to fetch food for their families .
off he goes , hopeful of finding something .
otherwise his family will be hungry .
the pier is great for fishing .
there are lots of great hotels at the beach .
sand art fish were sculpted .
is that location ?
location guards the beach .
there were not many people at the beach today .
i went for a short walk .
i like the buildings on the side of the beach .
there were some impressive sand sculptures .
they were very good .
the pier next to ocean to see the view .
the buildings close to ocean near the sand .
a sand made dolphin next to the ocean .
more sand made people in the sand made .
an a statue standing with a iguana on it .
we went to the beach to see the sandcastle competition .
it was a nice day at the beach even though it was a little overcast that day .
the first sandcastle was this beautiful fish with nice texture and detail .
while not as nice as the fish , this sandcastle showed a diver , poseidon , and a neat fish .
compared to the previous sandcastle , this version of poseidon was much better with greater depth and a realistic life-likeness .
we went down near the pier one evening .
we walked along the beach .
there were some really attractive statues .
this sandcastle was amazing !
i think this could have been location .
it was a long drive to the party .
there were many christmas decorations .
the sky was very clear .
i had a great time with my friends .
when we got back to the apartment we were very tired .
ok this totally sucks .
i hate this .
double photos is impossible .
please stop posting these .
we ca n't do them .
the day the aliens invaded location was the day i took pictures of my feet .
i was riding my bicycle when the beams of light came from the sky .
my mom rushed to pick my brother and i up . she took us to location location farm .
at location location farm the lights confused the aliens and they could n't find us .
the next morning i took pictures of the trees and water feeling lucky to be alive .
two friends decided on a christmas time road trip .
the elaborate christmas lights were quite spectacular .
they also took a little time for a nature outing .
they took pictures to remember the trip .
after a nice outing , it 's back to the city .
getting my feet wet in the creek .
getting ready to ride my bike on a nice fall day .
enjoying a long ride just looking out the window .
saw some christmas light decorations at night time , very lovely .
enjoying the peace and quit around the creek .
testing out my new organization camera that i got for my birthday .
the night sky . not that many stars or my camera did n't capture it .
i tried to be artistic here but i feel like i failed . this looks horrible .
over the town sunset . photo is black and white .
tried to add more colors to it . this is a pretty impressive shot .
it was a beautiful , blue sky day at the lake .
it grew gray and cloudy as my wife entered the water .
some creepy guys watched from the other bank , obviously enjoying her discomfort .
in fact , a lot of people were watching . we did n't like that , so we left the water and headed up the beach .
we settled down , far away from the water . ca n't see the lake from here , but at least we have privacy .
i went to the lake last weekend .
the water was great .
it was a small lake .
it was in the middle of the dessert .
the weather was very good last weekend .
we decided to head down to the bay .
we got in the water to cool off .
the lake was pretty massive and a lot of fun .
we walked around it a few times .
then headed back into the desert .
the location location is illuminated in the night .
it sits underneath the starry sky .
inside is helga , the organization guard .
inside the hotel is a graveyard .
if you walk behind the building , you see the ocean .
we were coming back home from the cemetery yesterday .
before we got in the car we decided to head to the beach .
our dog was very excited when we got there .
there were some nearby structures to sight see .
the weather was perfect that day .
we arrived at the beach not knowing what we 'd find .
the family dog was so excited to be in the water .
while he played we had an early dinner .
afterwards we took a walk down the beautiful pathway nearby .
we paid our respects to our parents before we headed back home .
we started our day at a veterans cemetery .
we passed the giant pool in the center on our way out .
later , we went to the beach too let the dog have some fun .
we saw some crazy stuff while we where there .
we walked for a while and just enjoyed the beach on a perfect day .
we started the day with a moment of reverence for the men and women who served our country .
the nearby reflecting pool gave us a place to consider the sacrifices they made for us .
we also made time to enjoy the natural beauty of our surroundings ( including our best friend of course ) .
even at the beach there 's something to learn about , as this monument shows .
we loved the endless beauty of this peaceful and profound place .
there are many memorials
near the fountain .
the dog is near the water
with the giant statue .
the water made the day nice .
the crowd waited expectantly .
here comes the first racecar !
it was a rally that day .
later steffi visited the bay .
and hiked over to the rocky ocean shoreline .
the car drove inside of the cones .
the crowd watched excitedly hoping for a winner .
the white car almost ran off the road .
the blue car sped around the curve really fast .
the red car was the fastest car in the race .
the car takes off and starts the race .
everyone watches and waits to see who will make it to 1st place .
some cars are drifting and turning and racing to 1st place .
same car rushing to the finish line trying to finish in 1st place .
while other cars are trying to still get to 1st place .
we went to a race recently .
so many cars were going fast !
it was in location location and it was gorgeous .
there was even a beach nearby !
it was pristine !
on the way to the dirt track . i think this guy might be heading for the race itself . i wonder if they 'll let my oldsmobile take part ?
i need a better vantage point . all i can see is dust and the backs of people 's heads .
oh yeah , now this is more like it . look at this guy go !
this guy is in second but he 's catching up fast . i 've been on this bend for 20 minutes and no one has crashed yet . how dull .
yeah , i 'm getting bored . come on ! people on watch this stuff for the crashes !
over the weekend we visited the local park .
the park had some amazing sights and wildlife . here i took a picture of a beautiful violet .
there are some rock climbing and hiking areas too for kids and adults .
we discovered a birds nest while were hiking up the trail .
this encounter was exciting and scary at the same time ! we encountered a snake while we made our way down the trail .
a young person decided to trek into the wilderness to enjoy some nature . as the clouds started to move out of the area it was evident it was going to be a beautiful day .
after a few hours they came across this random flower . they thought it was one of the most unique flowers they had ever seen , so had to stop for a photo .
just as the afternoon sun was proving to be hotter than expected , they came across an opening that lead to the water .
a sandy beach with gentle rolling waves beckoned them to take a swim to cool off .
however , they spotted this rather large snake , and decided it was probably time to head back home .
this is a picture of mountains .
this is a picture of a purple flower .
this is a picture of a red flower .
this is a picture of a bird .
this is a picture of a snake .
it was a beautiful july 4th today . my family and i went nature seeking .
we saw the prettiest flowers . some were lush , bright pink .
others were red . so many beautiful colors .
the birds were chirping . such a lovely sound .
we even saw a snake . it was scary !
the grass is very green
and the flowers are blooming
near the mountains .
the birds enjoy the view
and so do the snakes .
this is my husband [male] . he wanted to have a photo picture with the nice background .
a bridge where we walked before we go to the beach .
how lovely the birds are when they flew together .
foot prints on the sand reminds us how to be humble and how god loves us all .
a lovely place to be with our love . this reminds me that i am no longer be a kid just like the old days .
the surf was rough last friday when we went to the beach .
this was the path that meandered around the beach .
a person was taking advantage of the wind and parasailing .
this bridge went over the salt marsh near the beach .
a lone sandal that someone left behind .
we went on a hike today .
the first part was over a bridge .
we saw a huge flock of birds .
we ended up by the beach .
it was so good to sit down .
we headed out to walk down to the coast .
we followed the usual way by the train tracks .
when we got there , hundreds of birds where overhead .
we then walked down to the beach to find a good spot .
we pulled out our lawn chairs and enjoyed the day .
it is a gorgeous sunny day when the couple decides to visit the local beach .
they walk down the long boardwalk that leads to the beach .
a huge flock of seagulls flies overhead .
no one is at the beach but they see people have been from the footprints they left .
they put out their chairs and enjoy the beautiful scenery .
this man showed us how to control a camel .
further down the road we met this man who was a philosopher .
he led us toward this massive statue .
he said we should also visit this grand building which we saw after the statue .
the last thing we did was admire some figurines .
a man goes on vacation to an exotic area and sees many beautiful sights , and even a camel .
the place the man visits has a lot of old architecture .
while walking in the back alleys of the streets , the man sees a pig .
while travelling the city , the man takes a picture of some very old statues .
before leaving , the man takes a picture of one of the biggest attractions -- a holy temple directly across a beautiful lake .
[male] met us at the depot with a camel ; our adventure was on !
we passed by a statue of the great [female] , once used by the ancients to roast enemies of the state alive inside .
today , the natives ate a more mundane course of wild boar .
we finally arrived at the sacred temple of location .
across the lake was the glorious temple , its beautiful mosaic tile reflecting the midday sun like a dusty jewel .
the man was so excited to ride a camel on his vacation to location .
he loved being able to come here and eat real indian food ,
and to see the exotic sights .
of course , he went to the taj mahal ,
and of course he saw some unique indian treasures .
on our vacation to location , we got the chance to ride a camel .
while we were discovering the country we came across a statue of a cow .
in the village we also came across a wild pig wondering around .
we got to see some beautiful sculptures carved in the wall .
we also passed by the taj mahal .
this is the log house we live in when we go to vacation during the summertime .
this is a chair , in front of the house , that i usually sit on , in the morning and have breakfast .
this is a picture of the lake where we sometimes go to fish .
this is the forest area near the log cabin of where we stay .
this is a picture of [male] getting up from bed in the morning .

on our vacation we staying in a log cabin .
the view from the cabin was amazing .
first we went kayaking in the water .
then we found a large bird in the water .
after kayaking we watched the sun go down .
here 's the cabin we rented deep in the woods .
the furniture was handmade by the homeowner .
the fishing is supposed to be great here but we prefer to kayak .
here was our view from the cabin . it was very peaceful out in the woods .
my son was exhausted by our final day after so many activities .
the family took a camping trip to the location location . here is our cabin .
the cabin was along the river . we could see the changing leaves .
the river fed into this huge lake , which was accessible by canoe .
there was tons of wildlife , including this rarely seen blue heron .
the view from the back of the cabin . this was what we were lucky enough to see at the end of each day .
my friend used binoculars to see the flag .
from a far , he saw the flag on the boat .
the boat was far away near the other boats .
on the shore , i walked to look at the flowers .
my puppy stayed home and went to sleep .
the girl used her binoculars to spot her boat .
the boat dropped by and picked her up , and she went for a ride across the water .
after the ride , the boat pulled back into the dock , and she noticed other boats getting ready to leave .
once back on shore , she decided to go for a walk in the sand . it was a gray and chilly day .
she returned home to her sleeping pups , feeling as tired as they were .
[female] was excited to watch the ships go in and out of port today . she grabbed her binoculars so she could see them from her porch .
she watched as their flags waved in the wind ,
and she watched as they docked .
[female] walked around the beach to get a better look ,
but she got tired and decided to return home to cuddle with her precious puppy .
we have all gathered for a family trip in location .
taking a moment to shop for any last items we may need .
this is the boat we are taking to arrive at our vacation destination .
the boys seem to be enjoying the boat ride .
here we are . our own little paradise .
a family went on vacation .
to arrive at the destination , they took a boat .
their destination was a very nice beach where they could rest for everyday life .
yes , event at this remote location they could find familiar brands , such as coca-cola .
even more surprising , they could not escape organization !
we took the entire family on vacation .
first , we spent some time walking around the city shopping and visiting the street vendor 's booths .
then we hopped on a ferry to go to a remote island .
we were all excited about the relaxing day on the beach .
we stayed on the beach until the sun went down enjoying the breeze .
the entire family took a vacation to the beach .
first they rode a large boat in the ocean .
then they arrived to their destination .
after that they had breakfast by the beach .
they also started there day with some coffee .
we decided to take a family photo before we began our trip in location .
the streets were packed with many people and local markets .
we then decided to board a ferry with many other people .
it was a beautiful day out with the sun shining .
it was finally night time and we ended our day walking by the beach .
going to the beach is great . some like to play frisbee .
some beachgoers like to `` people watch '' and catch some sun .
then , there are the beach nappers . they need to beware so they do n't burn .
almost everyone enjoys a walk on the beach .
the end of a great beach day .
it was an overcast day but we went to the beach anyway .
i invited all of my friends .
after a few minutes there we started playing some games .
i brought out the frisbee .
it was hard to play because it was so windy .
our trip to the beach included some frisbee .
most of the ladies just soaked up the sun and talked .
some decided to take a nap in the warm air .
we went for a little walk to buy drinks and snacks .
by the end of the day , we gathered together to talk about what we 'd do for dinner .
we went to the beach earlier to celebrate the fourth of july holiday .
the whole family was able to make it out . that does n't happen often so it was nice to have everyone together .
the weather cooperated really well . it was hot , of course , but at least it was n't raining as the forecast said it might .
there were lot 's of other families out and about as well .
it was a blast having the family together today . i could n't have asked for a better holiday .
the boy was having fun on the beech
but was annoying the ladies
who were trying to sleep .
people walked along
and greeted the sleepers .
i decided to take a walk down to the dock yesterday .
i wanted to check out the boats .
i could see the shore in the distance after walking for a few minutes .
when i got there it was hazy but the water was calm .
i went over to the pier to look at the boats .
a path through the green forest .
the pier with the light tower on it .
the city from a view of the beach .
the pretty blue ocean glimmering .
we watched the boats in the harbor .
this is a picture of the woods .
this is a picture of the beach .
the skyline is in the background .

after deciding to walk to the marina they started down the trail to get there .
as they got closer to the water everyone was getting excited .
you can see the water she told the kids .
finally at the water everyone was ready to see all the boats .
finally at the marina the children squeeled with glee at seeing the boats docked .
the trees are very green
near the water
outside of the city .
the water is very calm
and the dock is beautiful .
everyone was there to watch the beach race .
they even had a marching band there .
i participated and ran as fast as i could .
i did n't win but i gave it my best .
i saw a lot of people sleeping in the park when i ran past .
so many contestants were getting ready for the decathlon this year .
my friend was participating in the decathlon and we can see him among the participants here .
i took a clear picture of my friend during the second part of the decathlon .
the race was so long and this was the finish line .
here i am with my friend after the finish line , i was really proud of him .
family and friends gathered around to cheer their loved ones on to victory .
there was even a marching band poised for action .
dad was running at a steady pace .
another contestant took time to pose with his friend .
and the young ones were completely exhausted .
the family is cheering on the runner
near the water
he is running very hard .
he won the race
before seeing people lay on the ground .
the runners seemed to gather in a collection , preparing themselves for the race to come .
as the water seemed to calm , some of the participants stood back to admire the view .
the crowd cheered wildly as he through himself forward , the finish line coming up in the distance .
the winner of the face posed for the cameras as he took this moment to take in the new found pride he felt .
after a long , eventful day some of the gathered crowd took to catching a snooze in the bright sunshine .
i had a great time at the concert last weekend .
there were so many great bands playing .
my favorite was the one with the female singer .
she was great .
i hope i can see them play again .
the new band went up to the stage .
their music was terrible . it was some of the worst music ever made .
it was so bad that some of the audience was becoming sick .
the music was so terrible that it was actually killing people in the audience .
the band laughed as everyone in the audience died .
[female] was a master at the keyboard .
[male] could make beautiful music with his guitar .
when [female] performed again she belted out a beautiful song .
[male] was also a gifted musician and guitarist .
for her final performance [female] belted out her latest hit single to her adoring fans .
we decided to head out to a local music show .
here 's the requisite artsy black and white photo .
the band was calm at times .
looks like sleepy at times almost .
the energy did pick up as the songs went on though . great music .
the band was playing well
and had a great guitarist .
the singer had a great time
and so did the other guitarist .
they were a great band .
this is the family 's favorite picnic spot .
we wait for mom to find our football .
i love my sunglasses , mom bought them for me .
duke is happy to be with us .
our burgers will be ready in no time .
[male] the dog decided to go out for a trip .
he chugged a soda to get him energized .
he scampered down to the river bank .
and met a funny little midget-human named [male] .
together [male] and [male] made a campfire and roasted hot dogs .
we took the dog with us to hang out by the river . he enjoyed it .
we bought healthy drinks with us to keep us cool .
the river had other visitors , and the sky did n't look like it was inviting more .
my son kep his sunglasses on even though it was cloudy .
we built a fire in the firebox to toast some marshmallows before leaving .
we went out to the beach to have a relaxing afternoon .
we threw the ball around for a bit .
i noticed the kid getting tires so we moved on .
we went back to the camp area . the dog seemed happy .
we ended the night with a bonfire in a pit .
the dog was being silly
after they gave it soda
near the big bridge .
the kid had glasses on
so the fire would n't burn his eyes .
i am a beach person and any day i can spend a day at the beach either alone or with my dog or friends is a good day with low stress which is what i love .
i like to pass the time doing the simple things like just throwing rocks and other natural objects into the ocean .
if there is drift wood then i like to do what i call a drift wood sculpture like this and i know not many would call it art but i like it so it 's ok .
i like to explore also and one of my other hobbies is being a rock hound so if i can find some big rocks or small to examine then i am one happy camper and this is one big rock .
another thing that just fascinates me are the waves at the beach which i could just stand for hours and hours watching looking for only god knows what to happen but it relieves stress so i do it kind of like meditation then i go home satisfied and happy .
[male] is training at the beach .
it 's going to take lots of hard work to get his body right .
he takes a break and throws a rock into the ocean and makes a wish .
he decides to head up to his hotel room to rest .
he snaps this picture from outside of his hotel room .
[male] and his dog , [male] , decided to take a walk on the beach this morning .
[male] loved when [male] tossed rocks into the ocean .
and , the scenery was great , especially the large piece of driftwood .
and , the natural rocks lying in the sand .
they finished the day by standing on a log and enjoying the water hitting their feet .
we had a great vacation on the beach .
i enjoyed relaxing under the umbrella .
my boyfriend had a great time .
the water pond outside the hotel was beautiful .
what a pretty vacation place , cant wait to go back .
the couple and their dog spent the day at the beach .
he tossed the dogs toy for him to run and get .
the dog then spotted this big log and thought he might beable to grab and play with it .
the rock was a nice place to sit and relax for awhile .
the dog wanted to play again so he stood out of the water and played with the dog .
my wife and i took some dancing lessons .
she kept looking up at the camera .
i had to figure out what she kept looking at .
i told her when she looked at the camera , she stepped on my feet .
she laughed and gave me a kiss .
the newlywed couple are very happy at their wedding .
after the wedding it 's time to say goodbye and get in the car .
they drive to a nice little beach get away area .
the newlywed wife gets into the water for a little fun .
the newlywed couple share a nice kiss on the beach .
the start of a wedding photo album .
the bride smiled in the car .
the newly weds took a vintage picture together .
the bride got her feet wet .
they gave each other a quick smooch .
they were the perfect couple , and their wedding day had finally come .
the bridge looked luminous ; she 'd never been more excited .
they could n't wait to begin their life together .
the honeymoon would be their first stop on their life together .
it was an absolutely magical week in paradise .
the guy was so happy
that he was marrying a beautiful woman .
they were smiling
and laughing
while kissing each other .
it was a long ride to the dock .
we walked by the waters edge to view the scenery .
many people were gathered by the dock to watch the water .
in the distance we could make out a beach .
just then a sailboat passed by us .
some friends traveled together on a long bus ride .
they reached their beautiful vacation destination .
they did some sightseeing to historical spots .
they also saw some modern art in the city .
they happily posed together to remember their trip .
on the trip i took a picture of some of the people we were on the bus with .
the view overlooking the water was amazing . we could see a small sailboat in the canal .
one of the monuments we saw was this statue of a man with a lance .
i thought this sculpture was neat . it reminded me of friendship .
this was a picture of a friend of mine i was with on the trip . we had a great time .
here we are getting ready to go on a ferry tour .
it 's just my girlfriend and i .
but look at all these people who are getting ready .
and here we go !
look at this beautiful trip .
a group of students from a local college went on a trip abroad .
luckily , most of them were friends and got along very well .
upon arriving , they had to take a ferry to the island where they would be staying .
they stayed on a solitary island where there was only one hotel .
the scenery was beautiful and the students thoroughly enjoyed the trip .
it was time to hit the beach !
nothing like a good read on the beach
the water was clear and so was the sky
this was their motel room
it was in the heart of miami
the island was empty most of the time .
we took the kayaks out to the island .
once there we set up camp and had our delicious meal .
once night had fallen we had the light of the stars to light up the island .
then we just relaxed and enjoyed our new camping experience .
it 's vacation time ! we decided for our first day , we 'd do an all day adventure package .
we went snorkeling .
we saw some amazing creatures and formations in the water .
the colors were so beautiful , and the experience felt magical .
as we rose to the surface , we were sad to go , but we knew more adventures awaited us .
today , we 're heading out to that island .
here we are getting our canoes ready to go .
on the island , we caught some tasty fish for lunch .
after a long day , the stars came out to play .
what a great ending to a great day , laying with friends gazing up at the cosmos .
this is a picture of the ocean .
this is a picture of the sea .
this is a picture of a starfish .
this is a picture of coral .
this is a picture of the deep sea .
we made the trip to my sister 's wedding .
the ceremony was short and simple .
all the guests had fun .
the reception was elaborate and well planned .
the couple was most beautiful !
the vehicle was smooth and relaxing .
when we arrived , there was a small waiting line .
the man in white told me not to cut or he would call the police .
when we finally got to the back , the partners were waiting to celebrate with us .
we went to the rocky beach afterwords .
on our way to the wedding .
vows were exchanged .
everyone congratulated the happy couple .
great bunch of wedding goers !
do n't fall in the water !
the friends of the groom were on their way to the wedding .
they got to the church .
the bridesmaids were there too .
after the wedding people had a meal .
the bride and the groom were happy with their wedding .
the road trip has begun !
when they arrived , they saw their friend , looking beautiful .
today was her wedding day and they were so happy to celebrate with her .
they gathered around with her family to toast the couple .
and then everyone watched and smiled as the couple took goofy pictures .
we were returning healed sea turtles to the water .
one by one , we carried them in teams .
they were cute turtles but very very heavy .
as a group , we collaborated to execute the event .
the bus was quick enough to take us home too .
after the big storm , many sea turtles were washed off course and beached far from the waters edge .
rescuers came from miles around when word spread of the turtle 's plight .
many people picked up the hapless turtles and returned them to their watery home .
all day and into the evening everyone worked together as a team .
when the sun set and all the turtles were safely back where they belonged , a tired but happy troop returned to their homes , too .
today there was an emergency on the beach . turtles had escaped and got lost in a building .
we had to carry them back out to the ocean .
they were so heavy it took two to three of us to carry just one .
we got them all back into the water and watched them swim away .
we got in our bus and went back to rescue headquarters .
today was the day to release the rehabilitated sea turtles back into the ocean .
the conservation team 's truck transported them to the beach .
onlookers watched as the team carried the turtles to the water .
everyone crowded around the turtles to watch them swim away from the shore .
the conservation crew headed back to the truck after a job well done .
three great turtles saved .
they would be transported in a special truck .
carried to the water .
then released back into their native habitat .
everyone had volunteered .
our car broke down outside of town .
we walked into the city , but where was everyone ? no cars were on the freeway .
there were no people in their apartments .
even the streets were abandoned .
we decided to get out of there and headed towards the bridge . we have watched the walking dead before .
the city looked abandoned .
the streets were quiet .
so were the bridges .
on the other side of this field lies a serene area .
a late just on the outskirt of the city .
i went to take a drive last week .
there was no one on the roads .
i decided to drive out of the city .
i saw a squirrel .
there was also a big lake out there .
both had slickers on .
it was misty .
since they 'd be walking they needed them .
it was several blocks .
they had to go .
just me and my partner come together every year to tour a city of choice
the bridge is so long and looks like it has the strength of bad boy production
all the buildings having different lengths , heights and coloration varying from each one them
the more precise look of economical business is worth venturing as well
with the overpass it gives sultry feelings as you go under and pass over
it was a beautiful day in the ocean
the houses on the shore line were perfect
an incredible day to be outside
and the sky showed no cloud
the beach was perfect today
the vacation villa where we will be staring at for the next two weeks .
a fishing boat coming home after long days at see .
watching a yacht coming to shore .
walking in the sand .
and going for a quick swim in the warm water .
the fishermen were coming in as i glanced out of the window .
dad showed me his view of the village .
in the nearby town the locals spent most of their time enjoying the sea .
from our village we often wonder whether or not the whole village may just sweep out to sea one day .
after midday it was time for me to go to work down at the beach .
i woke this morning to a loud horn blowing , and this is the view from our window ! love it !
the buildings are beautiful around here , but i really wish someone would 've warned me to wear better shoes ! my flippys are n't doing so well in all this mud .
after trekking through the mud we found our way to the beach .
i could n't believe how many buildings were right there ! built right against the water .
after a quick dip in the ocean our attention was drawn to these buildings , we did n't get too close , as i think it was private property , but needless to say there is so much adventure to be had here !
this is a tug boat off the coast .
the area is beautiful .
i think some of the buildings are going to fall into the water .
the view is spectacular .
these windmills are very pretty .
these were the hosts of the home where i stayed in my travel .
they had a beatifully decorated patio .
the different flowers they had displayed were so colorful .
their home was near a small lake .
we would sometimes go and row for fun .
grandma was ready to see some family today .
two of her boys showed up right on time .
of course one was late as usual .
we all went to the boat out back .
and away we went down the river .
took a vacation to location . these people treated me very well .
this was outside of my hotel room . what a lovely view from my balcony .
pretty flowers that were in the water . i had to get a close up for my wall .
looking further out i saw the biggest river with a sandy walkway .
i walked almost all the way to the end of it .
aunt seri looks a little worried here .
here she discusses the boat trip with her friends .
they posed for me before we left .
there is the little boat -- no wonder she was worried !
our last look at land before the long trip across the lake .
my wife 's family still lives in location .
my wife 's mother , and her mother 's two sons , live in a nice little home in southern location .
i had the chance to spend a good deal of time with them last fall .
they took me out to see some of location 's beaches .
in all honesty , the beaches were n't very impressive , but i pretended like they were .
[male] was a real surfer , in the platonic sense . he even had that stupid accent .
above all that , though , he was absolutely skilled at surfing .
he took leaps no one else could , no one else could even dream of doing .
even when he spilled , he took it like a real champ . what a master of the waves [male] was . what a dude .
we always watched him at competitions , and he always won . he was , apparently , a regionally ranked surfer . i could only be surprised that he was n't national .
surfer riding a wave .
and got out safely .
a bird waiting for his diner .
swimming calmly along the shore .
and catching a beautiful sunset .
i was on vacation last weekend .
i spent most of my time surfing .
i found a huge bird there .
it was a lot of fun .
at night there were a lot of lights on the pier .
this is a picture of blue waves .
this is a picture of green waves .
this is a picture of a man .
this is a picture of a man surfing .
a man is surfing in the waves .
the waves were really big at the beach
the surfers were enjoying it
even the birds seemed to like the show .
later that evening it calmed down .
the sunset at the beach was beautiful .
last month we visited location where we had the opportunity to see the proverbial edge of the earth .
this tourist attraction in location had a lot of rock formations that looked majestic with the weather .
[male] loved taking pictures of the different scenery we encountered .
do n't be fooled by the name of the location , there are a lot of places to hike and here as well . we climbed this rock all by ourselves .
there are cavernous regions for those who are daring but for [male] and i the sights and the climbing was enough to fill our appetite .
this is where we took a hike along the beach .
it was very rocky and rugged and quite chilly that day .
we stopped to take pictures of the dramatic scenery .
i especially enjoyed the geologic formations .
at the end of the hike , we paused to enjoy the ocean view .
this is a picture of rocks .
this is a picture of a man .
this is a picture of a man standing .
this is a picture of gray rocks .
this is a picture of the outdoors .
the rocks were very cool looking
and the guy wanted to hike up
so he could take pictures .
he got many good shots
of the very nice scenery .
the ocean stretched out before us .
this was an interesting rock formation . it looked like one rock had fallen atop the other two .
dad posed for a photo on the ledge .
the mountain crags in the distance were gorgeous .
we found a small cave partially blocked by a boulder in which to spend the night .
two friends stayed at a hotel .
the hotel had good access to natural spot .
the hotel had good entertainment features as well like a nice swimming pool .
there was access to a bar that was frequented by other visitors .
in general , the hotel was a tranquil location .
this man and his dad got drunk one night and decided to take a vacation .
they went to somewhere very tropical .
the hotel they stayed at had a very large pool .
there were palm trees everywhere along the beach .
they ended their day by watching the sunset on a boat .
i partied with some friends of mine at a resort near the shore one weekend .
in the morning , i got up and had a look around .
the resort had a pool , which my friends planned on using that day .
nearby was the shore and a lot of amazing tropical plants .
the ocean was absolutely gorgeous , and i could see why my friends wanted to come here .
view from our room at the timeshare . this was a great idea [male] thanks .
wow , cant wait to enjoy the full day tomorrow .
pretty pool , going to head down in a bit .
[male] and i parting it p at the local bar . great beer selection .
caught this cool shot this morning . not sure what the black dot is .
stag weekend ! here is our room at the resort . this would be our home base for the weekend .
the view from out the front door . we could see for miles out over the ocean .
the resort had an awesome pool , situated along the ocean .
but more importantly , stag weekend is about going out and having fun .
and sometimes too much fun . this was our view after waking up on the beach the next day .
we 're going to have sum fun today .
fun city is a really exciting amusement park .
i love skeeter ball .
a game of golf is always a good choice .
outside in the back is the roller coaster .
mom decided to surprise the family with a trip to location location .
little [female] was so excited she practically skipped into the amusement park .
the first adventure of the day was collecting tickets for prizes from ski-ball .
the miniature golf course was one of [female] 's favorite attractions , even if her dad won the game .
at the end of the day , everyone was exhausted from the rides and games , but a great time was had !
we were on the lookout for a family outing but were strapped for cash .
guess what , we had loads of family fun waiting for us right behind us but it somehow escaped our attention .
fun city location is a hidden treasure . its like organization has come to our doorstep .
there 's miniature golf too at location location location if you are in the mood for a quiet afternoon and yet filled with fun .
now which kid would not love to hop on to these . needless to say we had a great time at location location location .
the family was very happy
to visit the game place
that had many games .
there was also a giant octopus
and a ride to go on .
with the outlet strip so close by , the family quickly debated what stores they would try first .
location location location was certainly on the list for tourists to try as it provided a plethora of games at an affordable price .
the games lay stoically side by side , waiting for the children that would soon be playing them .
stationed at the amusement park was `` pirate 's golf '' , a golf course complete with a towering octopus that loomed overhead .
at the amusement park , a large roller coaster seemed to touch the sky as the tourists walked under it .
here we are enjoying the vip box of the stadium .
me and some college buddies decided to go to the baseball game .
my friend really wanted to go out with this girl .
while we were there , we met a a couple of our class mates .
after the game we all went to this club so we make connection with the girls .
my two friends were waving to us from the beach .
my blonde friend made a funny expression .
my friend was rowing his yellow canoe in the water .
my other friend was barbequing on the grill .
my two other friends were playing a board game .
the two friends were ready for a night out .
they were joined by more of their friends .
couples always like to have their pictures taken .
the whole gang decided to ham it up for the camera .
everybody was having a great time .
headed to the pub for a night out yesterday . just some friend and i .
just out for some smoke breaks here .
another smoker joins the group .
and yet another ! great way to meet people .
everyone had a great time .
the party was a great time
there were many photos taken
with couples
and friends
and even very large groups .
little ziti enjoyed his car ride .
we stopped and got out near a portable propane tank .
ziti seemed to enjoy the landscape .
here ziti is with his family .
and off into the sunset they walk ...
we packed up the pooch for our family trip .
when we finally arrived we were welcomed with all kinds of old timey mountain treats .
it was a good thing we drove the suv because the roads were non existent .
grandpa stopped to take a tic of me , mom , and dad .
but in the end , the best part of the trip was probably the view !
our dog was ready to hop out of the suv .
we stopped off of the main road .
we wanted to get shots of the rocks .
here 's our family photo .
we agreed to take a quick hike .
a family took their dog on their vacation .
they arrived at their destination and saw a unique vehicle !
the dog was scared , but he eventually came out of the vehicle .
they posed for a couple of pictures as a family !
the dog wanted to explore the area .
our puppy jumped out of the car on our road trip last week .
it seemed as if we would never find it in the vast expanse .
we drove around for hours looking for that dog .
finally , we tracked him down and the whole family was so happy .
after that we were able to fully enjoy the rest of our vacation .
this beach contains a heavy , abandoned telephone pole that you might wish to salvage .
if you plan to lift that heavy pole , you can prepare by practicing with imaginary barbells .
the beach provides sailboat parking . can you load the telephone pole onto a boat ?
a nearby lakeside picnic area provides table top parking for bicycles . not much help old moving old utility poles .
that leaves a boat as your best choice . however , you need to navigate around the sharp rocks carefully . do n't hurt your back ; lift with your knees .
we took a trip out to location location last weekend .
it was nice to sit around and visit .
the lake was nice and cool and inviting .
[male] brought his boat too .
he was eager to take us for a sail .
this is a picture of an ocean .
this is a picture of a woman outside .
this is a picture of a white boat .
this is a picture of the shore .
this is a picture of a rock .
we took the path that led to the beach .
we made brief camp along the way before continuing .
we finally arrived at our destination .
we walked the coast and came up on a boat .
the man who owned it was friendly and hung out with us for a bit .
the shore was calm
when the lady checked her phone .
then the boat came up
and the lady left
before she saw a big rock .
from my resort window is the view of the lake .
my kids and i are enjoying the sand .
a boater is just in front of us .
my daughters are playing games and hiding things in the beach .
the lake keeps me relaxed .
as we arrived the building piqued our interest as though an omen of something special .
being by the lake made for a good ambiance .
the kids could play while we relaxed .
there was even some just us alone time .
we 'll always have some vivid , up close , memories of this trip .
this is a picture of a building .
this is a picture of the beach .
this is a picture of people kayaking .
people are laughing at the beach .
this is a picture of an empty beach .
we could finally take off on a well deserved family vacation . this is a pic of our resort in location .
the weather was a bit foggy no doubt but still did not dampen our spirits .
tons of boating waiting for us and aqua life to sea .
aw , ai n't that pretty . this is only time our kids did noy quibble in a long while
the sight for sore eyes . if only this escapade went on forever .
the window shades were open
and the kids were playing
along the cool water .
they jumped up and down
before they saw the waves tremble .
we 're about to leave our little cabin in the wood and go for a trek !
[male] did n't want to stay in the cabin so he convinced us all to go with him .
we took our beloved horses with us , we thought that some exercise would be great for them as well .
the trek was just lovely , and we followed a stream all the way to the end , breathing in the beautiful sight and fresh air .
this is the picture we took at the end of our trek , just in time for the sunset !
my father is a crazy old fool that lives out in the wild .
he says the grass tells him secrets .
we climbed up this cliff . i almost got pushed off .
we saw this dam . my dad said this dam was built to hold in his secrets .
i was able to escape my father by traveling with these horse riders .
we left the cottage to see the sights .
we stopped by the shore and started exploring
people where up on the rocky ledge above us .
from there , we visited the local damn before hitting the road .
on the way back we were ran into by a group of horses .
[male] decided to take a vacation at a nice little cabin .
he wanted to stay somewhere rustic and near the mountains .
[male] had to ride horses to get to his mountain cabin .
while riding his horse he passed this lovely stream .
this is the view from the porch of his cabin .
the house was nice
along the river bank .
the man went on a horse ride
to see the forest
and the big lake .
enjoying a very tasty sandwich with my sweetheart .
did some site seeing . could n't believe how tall many of the buildings were .
listened to some music in the park.there were a few great bands .
a lot of people showed up.turned out to be a big even in our park .
sitting in the shade.the sun was in my eyes.luckily nobody else was under the tree.had a great day in the park .
we rushed down to the market . we could n't look suspicious , but we moved as fast as we could .
but we were too late . the grilled cheese had taken over everyone .
we were forced to pray to the mighty grilled cheese .
it welcomed us with open arms .
we are one with the grilled cheese . let its deliciousness flow through us forever .
it was a great day for shopping at the outdoor mall , and a husband and wife sauntered past a bookstore .
soon the couple got very hungry , so they decided to try some free samples a restaurant was offering .
later , when it was time for lunch , the man ordered a delicious sandwich .
they sat down on a bench to enjoy their lunch .
a woman sitting next to them showed them the food she was eating , but they were happy with their own choices .
people are sitting on a bench .
this is a picture of a building .
this is a picture of a band .
this is a picture of a gathering .
this is a picture of people sitting .
the new couple decided to take a trip together , but so far their trip has been boring .
what better way to spice things up than with some food ?
local delicacies are great , even when they 're dead simple .
the couple 's spirits are improving already !
even if the sandwiches do n't satisfy their appetite , there are plenty of interesting foods out there for them to try .
this is where i went on vacation .
i took a hike up the mountain and into the forest .
the view was amazing .
i was loving the scenery until i saw this .
the silly bear followed me everywhere i went until i got on the other side of an electric fence .
check out these beautiful vacation photos
i loved the blue filter i used
of course i took a nice photo of [male] .
[male] also took a photo of me
then the boat came to take us back to the airport
[male] started at sea level .
he hiked up the mountain so high that the cars looked like ants
the brave adventurer continued , nothing could stop him..
wait is that a bear ? run !
[male] jumped clear over the fence and thinking he was safe stopped to take another picture .
first , we went to the beach .
later , we traveled to the mountains .
as we got higher , we got a closer view of the skies .
the mountains were green and lively .
lastly , we got to see a friendly bear .
the docks are beautiful when the sun is coming out .
looks like another world !
great place to hike . clean air and beautiful sights .
lots of people to see . wish i brought my rollerblades too .
this is my baby . i try to take it out at least once a week .
i bought an old camera at an online auction .
it came with a long lens .
i have n't used real film for awhile .
it also came with batteries for the flash .
the tripod will help me take time lapse pictures .
i 've got all of my cooking gear for hiking the long trail .
plenty of film to document my journey .
my trusty canon to take some great pictures .
all of my hygiene gear for cleaning up and feeling human again .
this is what i will be living out of for the next 30 days while hiking .
we decided that we 're going to go camping so i packed all of the things i 'll need for the trip .
i have film to catch all of the precious memories .
ca n't forget the camera . what 's film without a camera ?
ah , yes ! must keep up my hygiene on the trip !
and now i 'm all packed and ready to go .
she was trying to sell her camera so she could have a little extra money .
the lens itself cost almost as much as the camera did .
it even includes the film that the person would need to get developed .
it also includes the batteries that the camera will need .
finally it also comes with a tripod . this is a very great deal .
i still use a 35 mm camera .
the extra lens comes in handy for long distance shooting .
film comes in containers and has to be later developed .
batteries are essential for adding light to flash pictures .
a tripod is necessary for team or group timed shots .
we took the kids to the beach today , they love the sand .
heres our daughter dragging her brother into the water .
the littlest one loved digging for sea shells .
this beach even had some beautiful flowers that helped fill the air with sweetness .
walking back to the car my feet were killing me but it was a great day .
the beach by the resort was jaw dropping .
my two children played until they were exhausted .
i snapped a photo of this mountain hoping that one day we could climb it together .
next , we found these lovely flowers to embrace .
i walked barefoot in the sand to really cherish the experience .
this is such a picture perfect day to go to the beach with the family .
brother and sister ca n't wait to get to the water .
mom is there to make sure everything goes well and the children are safe .
these flowers are growing near the beach , so vibrant in color .

we decided to follow a path during our summer vacation , not knowing where it would lead us .
we made our way to the beach and saw this neat little cabin , inhabited , and we decided to get closer .
the beach was so beautiful that the cabin was quickly forgotten , and , instead , we decided to take panoramic pictures of the sights .
it was really worth it , with the sun setting and the waves crashing on the rocks .
we even got to take this awesome picture of [male] standing on the cliffs just right after the sunset .
the sandy dunes marked the spot where we began our morning walk .
we spied a lone surfer in the distance .
we passed by a lifeguard 's stand .
beautiful views were all around !
it was a great spot for solitude and contemplation .
we wanted to see the beach before the autumn air made it more difficult .
the lifeguard stand was empty and had been since the weather started getting cooler .
the water looked just as beautiful even though we knew it was cold .
the waves were peaceful and relaxing .
before we left we climbed up to the summit to watch the sunset .
the grass was blowing
near the beach house .
the waves were coming up
and hitting the rocks
when the sun was going down .
the wind picked up and the rolling hill seemed to come alive as the breeze passed through the foliage .
as the water lapped against the rocks at the edge of the mountain , a lone figure watched it peacefully .
the gentle waves caressed the side of the beach as the solitary beach house loomed over them .
light hit the top of the hill , illuminating it against the storm that began to press in from the west .
a figure stood at the top of the mountain overpass , looking down at the peaceful lake below .
[female] loved eating authentic mexican food .
the enchilada she ordered was too big and she shared it with her family .

the family decided to go to the beach today with our best friend .
dad and debating on whether or not we should try the sea .
finally we just got our feet wet and that was it .
dad thought the water was a bit cold and was n't going for a swim .
we felt a little hungry and we went to the restaurant on the boardwalk .
we had a great time walking along the beach but dad got some stones in his shoes

i spent all day at the beach .
it started to get dark but i did n't want to go back home .
the tide started to come in .
i saw the moon overhead after about an hour .
i decided to leave before it got too dark .
we found each other on the beach , like always .

we whispered secrets into each others ears .
we accepted our fates and waited on the beach .

having fun just to enjoy the place .
one of the native workers digging at the excavation site .
the mountains along the coast were beatuiful .
our group going out on a boat tour .
party time after a long day of working and tours .
this was a really interesting rock formation in the desert near by .
we took a tour of ancient civilizations in location . we started through a tour in a cavernous area .
we got a great picture of the hills and valleys of the land .
the water was so beautiful and clear .
and of course we had to pick up some beer !
it 's amazing the things you can see from history .
we got some local drinks !
but it took a long car ride .
the street was barren .
we saw some people on the road .
man , they were crazy .
we had a couple of drinks before we traveled .
we traveled by car .
the land was open and had a couple of houses .
the land was barren , but open .
lastly , we felt the temperature of the ground by laying on our stomachs .
me and my buddies went biking in the mountains last weekend .
the terrain was rough , but doable .
it was neat to read about the area and the different layers of rock .
this shows the different layers . amazing !
we took a break and had lunch while enjoying the view .
the boys getting ready to go riding in the desert .
[male] almost taking a digger , but hanging on .
this was our brief yet filling lunch break .
[male] posing on the edge of a cliff .
a very unique rock formation in the middle of the desert .
this is a picture of a group of friends .
this is a man biking .
this is a picture of a sign .
this is a picture of a canyon .
this is a picture of a group of people .
we 've decided to trail bike in the desert today .
the sand is tricky to ride through .
steep edges challenge even the most experienced .
the victory stance after having made it through the day .
the desert has many unusual and eye catching formations .
the bikers were leaving for go on the mountains
and down the cliffs .
they were taking a break
to view the cliff
and the pretty landscape .
hazardous water sign .
undrinkable water and waste .
walking along the train tracks .
duck swimming in the lake .
watching the sunset .
a day at the park just me and my dog .
took this path first what a beautiful picture i see before me .
here we came across a little bridge and stream .
watching the water is wonderful and relieves stress .
ran across this sign they must have boats in this water .
a local government has shut down different water ways because of a potential pollution hazard .
they shut down the water ways because of a potential sewage leak .
the sewage link is believed to have come from an old abandoned subway track .
wildlife seem unaffected at this point .
the city government hopes to have it cleaned up soon .
we are experiencing one of the warmest summers on record , but we ca n't hop into the river because it is polluted .
sometimes i 'm tempted to jump off the bridge into the water and take my chances .
there are so few other things to do outside near my home .
if the ducks can survive the water i probably can , too .
if the sun keeps shining i will have no choice but to take a swim .
the sign warned them
not to enter the bridge .
they took the tunnels
and they saw a duck
in the sunset .
with the weather so nice we decided to head down to the boat and take it for a cruise .
once on board and making the departing preparations we were on our way .
on the way out of the harbor we saw several sea lions on the channel marker , soaking up the sun .
the pelicans gathered in large groups with the low tide offering them a feast .
once out on the open water , we spent the rest of the day just cruising along .
we spent over a month at sea in this ship .
here i am working on deck .
the deck was n't as big as you might imagine .
we saw seals and all kinds of wildlife that i 've never seen in the wild !
this was a welcome sight as it meant we were nearing home !
the young man wanted to do more in the boat , but his dad would not let him .
his dad was the captain and did all the work alone .
every day was the same and the dad wouldnot let his son help .
all the son could do was look out at the animals .
eventually their business closed because of the dad 's selfishness .
i had a beautiful view of the ocean from the boat .
my friend getting a good look out the window .
i saw some seals hanging out and enjoying the sun .
there were dozens of beds lined up looking for food along the shore .
the view from when i was relaxing in the back of the boat .
the family went out on their boat .
they had a fancy boat with a nice interior .
there was a lot of nature outside .
the birds flocked the shore .
it was a fun day on the boat .
our winter at home are very beautiful and lonely .
as far as the eyes can see there is snow , snow , and more snow .
even walking between the barn and the house can be a chore .
the sun shines brightly , but does little to warm the air up .
even the trees the sunlight shines on the ice and creates some beautiful scenery .
i was out walking in the snow and somehow got lost .
i do not know which way to go to get back to the farm .
the sun is going down and soon it would be dark .
those fence post sure look familiar .
well , i can relax now and get something hot to drink .
my favorite time of year is winter .
i was so excited to go on a retreat with my work to a winter cabin .
we stayed in log cabins using only sleeping bags .
the weekend was designed to increase our team building skills .
everybody had a great time and by the end of the weekend we all felt rejuvenated .
we took a winter vacation to the mountains .
here you can see the tracks we made in the snow .
then , we wanted to go sled riding . the snow has the tracks from us dragging the sled .
we stopped to take a picture of the beautiful , clear sky with the bright shining sun .
all of the trees around us were snow covered , and it was beautiful .
we had a brief weekend stop in beautiful location .
the snow looked so beautiful , as if it was here all along .
we took a snow bike , and these were the trails from the tires of the snow bike .
the sun setting was absolutely the most enchanting thing that i have seen in my life .
the way the sun was setting behind the tress , was simply stunning .
one day we were jogging on the beach .
suddenly the water became very still .
we noticed a pile of colored flags but what was it ?
then we came upon an odd stone with hieroglyphs written upon it . could aliens have been here ?
then we saw it ! a massive flying saucer took off over our heads . we will never forget that day .
we decided to hike to the lake .
there was a sign in chinese that marked the trail .
we set off from the camp with bright flags .
it was a long walk to the lake , some of our group lagged behind .
when we all reached the lakeshore , we came together for a group photo .
my first time to the chinese north sea .
it was so narrow and blue .
i found a large mound of colored trash surrounded by colored flags .
i also found a huge rock with chinese symbols all over it .
the man were saluting it and waving their hands around . it was weird .
i went to the beach last weekend .
the view was amazing .
there was a lot of decorations around .
there were some monuments as well .
we had a great time there .
the lake shone brightly as the group looked down .
on their way to the water they stumbled across a rock with symbols on it .
they continued walking and began to see colors , it looked like a festival .
not wanting to disturb they walked the other direction .
they all pulled out their cameras to take a picture to remember .
this was a view from our private balcony .
there was a nice park near the resort along the lake .
we loved relaxing in the park and people watching .
the beach glowed right around sunset .
we ca n't wait to visit this place again !
the park is a quiet place .
you can play on the water .
the trees are good for shade .
the city is s busy place .
the water is a beautiful place .
went to location 's coast and i 'm glad i did .
palm trees everywhere and such shady areas .
i sat here for a couple of hours basking in the sun .
this is a picture from my hotel room . i am happy to be here .
this is from the helicopter ride i took . amazing view .
i arrived at my hotel and walked out onto the balcony . the view from my balcony is spectacular .
after freshening up in the hotel i took a walk around the grounds to explore .
it was so peaceful walking around and seeing the sights .
i headed back to my hotel and took another moment to admire my view .
then i went on a sight seeing excursion on a boat along the bay . there were great views of the city !
i had always heard great things about beaches in location location so i visited one last weekend .
the weather was pretty gloomy , so the situation was n't ideal .
i was particularly shocked to see palm trees in location location .
i was not at all surprised to see the tall buildings along the coast line .
once the weather cleared up , i went to my hotel balcony and caught a great glimpse of the ocean and it 's beauty .
we started our beach tour at the lighthouse .
from it , we could see for miles .
the shores rocks were chiseled .
the wind had eaten them away .
when dust fell , we felt like we had witnessed greatness .
[male] was on vacation for an entire two weeks but there were so many places to go he could n't decide .
so , on day one he just headed out on the road .
he spent time just lazing on the beaches .
sometimes he toured tourist attractions like historic lighthouses .
when the two weeks had ended he headed home with the sunset happy and satisfied .
my trip to the haunted lighthouse was so scary . i went inside and i felt spirits all around me .
after i left i had a vision of this cliff .
i left off it and landed on the shore .
i ran after i had my vision and ended up at a similar shore and i wanted to jump so badly .
i got in my car and drove back home as fast as i could .
today we stood before a beautiful light house on our vacation
the beautiful coastline stood before us , we were in awe .
the rocky crags at the beach were just one of many sights we took pictures to remember
a last photo of the ocean that we wanted to share
and the last sunset on our way back to the hotel .
today , we are going to go to go sightseeing .
first , we will go to a park .
this park has beautiful caves and rocks in it .
next , we will go to see a lighthouse that is in the area .
on the way home , we will see if there are any fun places to stop at .
it was a lovely night to be on the beach .
we were in search of seashells and a good time .
we found a bird along the way and he was searching for worms .
we continued to enjoy our stroll on the cool sand .
and , we finally ended up at the lagoon , our favorite place .
despite the cold weather , a woman went down to the beach .
even though it was cold , there were still sights to see .
she saw some unique objects that you would n't see at other times .
she was also there to see people fishing in the wonderful fishing weather .
she had a great time and saw a different side of things .
[female] loved the ocean .
she would come out to her favorite beach , even when it was too cold to get in the water .
she saw a majestic bird sitting on the edge of the water .
then she decided to walk back home with some of her friends .
the sky and the land were beautiful in the evening .
being out here at dusk is beautiful , the color of the sky is like no other .
the beach is like sacred land as far as i`m concerned .
the birds and most of the other animals are at total peace here .
sharing this vision of beauty with friends is great .
the sky is bright yet the sun is going down .
[female] and i went to the beach .
there was a cool bird there .
there was also a large bundle of sticks .
we saw a guy named [male] fishing .
[female] had a lot of fun at the beach .
our tropical vacation was so much fun .
all of us had a fantastic time .
the place where we stayed was beautiful and relaxing .
there was so much nature for us to see .
the local wildlife was everywhere .
on vacation with the family in location .
my beautiful wife . it was nice that we got the beach to ourselves .
me and my beautiful wife . this is our third anniversary . we go to location every time .
my wife 's sister . i do n't really like her . but do n't tell my wife i said that .
i was very bored that day . so i took pictures of these birds .
i was standing by the ocean under a palm tree .
my sister and i together on the beach .
our yard with a pool in it . love relaxing on the chair .
my sister and her husband standing on the sidewalk .
watching a humming bird eat out of the feeder .
two women and a man visited a tropical resort .
in addition to the resort being by a tropical forest , it was also on a beautiful beach .
although the women were in beachwear , the man was more interested in sightseeing only .
the location was a wholly enjoyable one .
there were even nice quirks , such as feeding the local , unusual wild birds at close proximity .
the girls were ready for their day at the beach .
the sisters loved to hang out together .
unfortunately the beach was crowded , so they headed to the pool .
the younger sisters boyfriend shows up and they all hang out together .
they stand on the porch admiring the nice flowers .
the beer was easy to open and drink .
my husband wore a hat that protected his face .
the sky was truly magnificent in depth .
my husband took a picture of me building in the sand .
my husband used his hands to peel a fruit .
[male] was a beach bum .
[male] of sand by the water was his favorite sight to see .
he loved to kick up the jams .
with friends along the water , he held hands .
not even the night clouds could drive him away .
refreshing beverage on this hot day .
enjoying , and reflecting on life .
beautiful skies , glad it did not rain .
making a sandcastle .
nothing beats fresh coconuts .
a drink or two kept the heat at bay .
and a sunhat was practically needed in this weather !
the sky looked gorgeous .
everyone was definitely excited to be here .
some food was appreciated as well .
today , i went to the beach .
when i got there , there was nobody else around .
i decided to relax by having a beer .
the only people i saw the whole day was this couple walking by the shore .
in the afternoon , it got very cloudy , so i decided to leave .
i love photographing my friends in nature .
welcome enjoy going on hikes through the woods , and decided to go on a hike today .
our plan was to hike the hills until we reached a tiny harbor .
the hike took a couple hours up and down rolling hills , i managed to get some great photographs .
by the time we reached the harbour everybody was ready for a swim , it was a wonderful day .
this is our new property .
it is right on the lake .
it has a forest area .
it also has a place for our cattle .
here is the spot we are building our forever home . life is good .
my group left early in the morning to get some nature photos .
i felt that these rolling hills next to the sea were really crazy looking
here 's a photo of some local shrubs and trees we saw .
my group pressed on ahead and were met with some local fauna .
it was a nice day of hiking , but after this last picture , we headed back .
the walking tour through hansen park was fun .
it was sad to learn that several trees were fighting disease .
but the moors were just beautiful .
watching the tall grass sway in the breeze off the water was heavenly .
it was definitely worth the trip !
we were taking a hike on a famous trail .
we spotted this perfect view of the ocean on our trail .
the seas were rough , look at that water splash so high over the mountain .
as we were walking , we saw an individual who was bird watching .
we were so glad to see this meadow , because it symbolized the end of the hike .
while the house was n't quite what we expected ...
we were worried more about the lovely beach in front of us ...
and , the scenery that only cabo provides .
we spent the week kayaking and swimming ...
and , enjoying the beautiful surroundings .
[female] and [female] went for a walk .
they walked along the beach .
it was a beautiful morning and just right for a stroll .
they went all the way to the old house in the cove .
then , they turned around to walk home .
the beach was empty during the evening .
only the waves remained to keep me company .
i followed some footsteps to see if people were around .
then i came across a little beach house .
the owner was happy to have a visitor and we ended up taking a walk on the beach together .
i went to the beach last weekend .
the sea was very calm .
i had a great time there .
there was a small house out there .
after a while i left and went back home .
this is a summer home where a couple comes to enjoy their summer .
they take walks along the beach .
the scenery is amazing and a sight to see .
there is a lot to do at the beach home , like kayaking .
the little town sits atop a little hill over looking the water .
we kayaked into the cavern , unsure of what to expect .
we navigated the rocks and continued moving downstream .
suddenly , we hit a pocket of rapids and the trip became treacherous .
finally , we pulled into smooth waters ...
and docked for the night .
i went on a hike last weekend .
there were a lot of beautiful pools there .
it was very dry there .
there was a little bit of water .
it was beautiful at sunset .
the canyon was a good place to visit .
people came to the national park to see the canyon .
the mountain range was another feature people came to see .
there were also frozen rivers .
the national park was a beautiful place .
it is amazing to capture the beauty of mountains , even the gaps between them .
if caught just right it is like peeking into the sky or possibly heaven .
the river below runs a long stream , almost like a path to follow .
but when the sun shines on it , the beauty is caught so perfectly .
but often if somebody wants something simple a mere walk on a peer at the beach is always fun .
the hike was beautiful .
the couple looked down and saw the almost fake looking blue water .
and in every direction you looked , something else beautiful appeared .
you could see water , and rocks , and beach , and forrest . it was unbelieveable .
they felt so lucky to call this place home .
the butterfly exhibit came to the convention center and there was a botanical garden as well .
this type of plant caught my eye and even though i ca n't pronounce the name , i love it .
this plant , we learned was only located in a remote part of the world .
a tiny wood pecker landed on a branch near me hoping that i had something for him to eat .
these plants are among the most deadliest plants in the world .
a stroll by the beach today with me and my girlfriend .
we then wandered into the forested area and saw this beautiful flower .
these yellow flowers smelled incredible .
this flower looked like something out of a sci-fi movie .
before leaving for the day , we saw this bird that did n't make a move as we approached it . amazing .
i went kayaking out to an island because i wanted to photograph some of the beautiful flora there .
a bright pink flower caught my eye first , just blooming with the first sign of spring .
next , i found a spindly orange flower that cascaded over its leaves .
not too far away , another spindly flower grew , this one red and puckered with baubles at their ends .
as i was photographing all the flowers , i almost did n't notice the cute little bird next to me , who must have been watching me work the whole time !
we explored the ourtoors that day and saw a lot .
there were so many interesting things to see .
there were very strange colors and figures in the forest .
there was a cool bird that we saw and it looked at us suspiciously .
i saw some white flowers and got one for my friend cause her favorite color is white .
this picture is along the location coastline .
this is a photo i took of a beautiful wild cactus flower
here is another flower . i thought the colors are just amazing .
i love how i captured this hanging bulb flower .
on our hike back , i zoomed my cam on this bird just hanging out on a branch .
a group of friends and i decided to go cross country skiing .
it was the perfect day for it , so we took off early in the morning .
we skied a long for a couple of miles .
we all agreed seeing the breathtaking sites was good for our souls .
of course the day is not over until someone falls , we all got a good laugh .
i went skiing with a group of friends .
the views were beautiful , so we went off the trails a little bit .
we decided to take a break from skiing just to enjoy the amazing view .
we got tired , so we ended up just walking the trail .
i was so exhausted , i just fell down in the snow !
we took a group outing to the ski slopes .
the mountain was steep , and i was scared .
we stayed together , and it was nice having encouragement from my friends .
some of them did a slope with lots of trees , but i decided that was n't for me .
i took another slope . and even though i fell , i would do again in an instant !
friends gather on the mountain for a day of skiing .
traversing the mountain trails .
cross country skiing is always invigorating .
what a beautiful view of the trees .
i had a wipe out on my first day on the slopes .
they had n't ever been skiing before .
not a one of them .
they had to start on the bunny slope .
hardly any grade to it at all .
but they still managed to fall .
we went to location for our honeymoon .
it was really nice and green .
the best part were the beaches , they were beautifull .
i loved playing in the water and surfing .
i ca n't wait to go back and lay on the beach .
my wedding day in location .
delicious coconut juice . the best i ever had .
not the best hot dog i had . not a lot of meat .
got it from this place . worst fast food restaurant in the world .
this was the worst trip i ever experienced .
a day in the life of a beach bum .
here i 'm riding to the beach to soak up the sun .
renting my surfboard for the day .
here i am trying to surf , but i 'm not very good .
i think i 'll stay on land .
they looked cute in their new sundresses .
they had bought them in town .
they were both hoping to catch the attention of certain some ones .
both were surfers .
neither of the girls knew how to surf , so they just sat around hoping to be noticed .
after the beautiful wedding on the beach the newlyweds decided to see what else the island had to offer .
first they decided to try some sorbet , which both of them liked very much .
they then decided to try some of the local food by eating this strange type of sub .
next , they headed into a local shop to cool down and try some more island food .
the evening was finished off by a walk on the beach en route to their hotel .
when we bought our new car we took a road trip .
we went to visit the spanish mission .
the cheerful blue doors beckoned us welcome .
as we walked in the narrow hall , the mission dog greeted us .
after watching the most beautiful sunset , we drove home . happy and at peace .
i went on a bday outtin to a nice place
i also brung my cat with me
the hotel was funny looking
i really like the place
the sunset was great .
our tiny little rental car was fun for our vacation .
we saw some beautiful old structures .
the city seemed like it was carved out of stone , but the man made parts of homes were so colorful and reflective of the culture .
the alley ways looked like the stuff of movies !
we were treated to a spectacular sunset at the end of the first day . what a beautiful trip !
i went on vacation last weekend .
i packed my bag and took my cat with me .
i stayed in a place with a blue door .
i planted my flag on the top of the mountain .
at sunset i went to the beach .
this is the electric car that we rented on vacation .
here is a church that we found with an awesome sunset in the back .
here is a door that takes you into a new place .
my boyfriend is walking down the tunnel with our dog ahead of him .
later , we watch a beautiful sunset over the ocean .
they needed a change of scenery after spending so many days in the city .
they passed through the hillside .
the beach was where they decided to stop .
surrounding the beach was ruins from an old town .
the site was historical and a much needed change of pace .
there were a lot of great ruins while i was on vacation .
i stayed close to the sea .
the buildings were very old and run down .
the ruins were huge .
i almost tripped over all the rocks strewn about .
we awoke at sunrise to begin our adventure .
the landscape was beautiful !
first we went to the natural springs .
after that we visited some old ruins .
the ancient cobblestone pavement was awesome to behold .
the land was ver dry
even with the water near .
the city was old
and had ruins
that had been there for thousands of years .
arriving as the sun went down over the mountains .
rising in the morning , what a beautiful day .
sand as far as you could see .
these ruins look ancient , i wonder what they once were .
stones made up the streets , imagine the labor to do this .
this town was used to large amounts of snow .
whenever a large snow fall would happen , snow plows on the fronts of trucks cleared the streets .
as long as the lake does n't freeze over , the ducks did n't mind the snow either .
these ducks were used to the cold .
overall it was a cold winter , but the townspeople were used to it .
it had been snowing all night long , we did n't know what we would wake up to in the morning .
as we expected , the streets were covered in inches of snow !
while it was almost warm enough to go for a bike ride , there was just too much snow covering both the streets and our bike to even think about it !
instead , we decided to go for a long walk and thankfully someone had given us an easy path to follow .
to the end of the path we were surprised to see a few ducks swimming around . at least someone 's enjoying the weather !
after the storm had settled everything was in a blanket of white .
the roads were still mostly covered with snow so there was n't much traffic .
even the lakes and docks areas were mostly abandoned .
the animals did n't really seem to mind however .
needless to say , we really were n't going anywhere anytime soon .
the snow covered all of the cars
and the trees
and the boats too .
the ducks did not mind the snow
but it covered the bikes .
as fast as the cars parked , they were covered in snow .
the trees were bare and the world was white .
even the boats fell victim to the snowfall .
luckily , the water had n't frozen and the ducks were able to paddle about .
these posts look like giant snowcones .
me and my pup taking a stroll along the beach .
he is so handsome ... and ready to play .
this is my mom and me . she joined us for a walk .
do n't think my pup could bring me this stick ... haha .
oh , he 's all tuckered out and ready to head home for dinner .
the waterline is down and sand is become rocky .
my dog and i are enjoying the experience .
my dog [male] is owning the shore !
the stones have been smoothed by the water over time .
the colors vary , but carry mostly a grayish tone .
this is a picture of a woman with her dog .
this is a picture of a dog .
this is a picture of two women .
this is a picture of water .
this is a picture of a dog on rocks .
the woman took a photo smiling
and her dog was happy too .
her mom was the happiest
that they saw the water
and were alone with the dog .
bruiser and i arrived at the rocky beach .
he was n't too sure , as the rocks hurt his feet .
my friend and i were having a great time .
this is a view looking over the lake from the shoreline .
bruiser is getting used to the rocks under his paws .
surfing is a challenge .
standing up on a surfboard while on a wave can be impossible for some .
a lot of people like to ride their board by lying on it .
wipeouts are still common .
if you can learn to ride the wave without falling you might have a great time .
i had no idea what i was doing on the waves , but i sure had loads of fun.my friends and i spent a day surfin the waves .
the waves were n't very big but sure gave a run for our money still .
when we got tired we laid on the nice warm beach and dried off .
then we got back in the water and got wet again .
awesome waves finally hitting , glad we waited and took a break !
this surfer was having some trouble catching waves .
his friend was more experienced on the boogie board .
they set off down the deserted beach to find a better spot .
wth ? does poseidon , god of the sea , just hate this guy ? he could n't even get into the water .
his friend continued riding through the tubes as , he sat on the beach and smoked .
what a great day for a bodyboarding competition and here is the first participant now !
the second comes down and rides inside the pipe for a great performance .
the next guy rides high on the wave before shooting down towards the sand .
another rider shoots through the pipe as it starts crashing over him .
the last rider of the day heads across the wave with incredible speed .
the waves were strong
and the people kept crashing .
they would get back up
to hit the waves again
before they settled down .
we are on vacation and we went on a whale watching cruise today .
this is my family taking pictures off the deck .
we did n't see any whales , but we saw a lighthouse and some boats in the distance .
this seagull found a great perch to see the action on .
the tour guide is telling stories , and they are so boring !
most of the cars still have snow on them .
the lake is already frozen .
there are still berries on the trees for the birds .
we saw this boat with a bunch of ducks around it .
even the bikes were still covered with snow .
after arriving at the harbor we decided to do some sightseeing .
you could see a lot of little islands in the distance .
we also saw a lot of boats around the area .
not to mention the wildlife was very active no matter where you went .
overall it was a very nice trip and a beautiful port town .
the water was very calm
and the people were taking photos .
there was a white building nearby
with birds on it
and very loud horns .
there is a great view of the water .
the visitors are taking pictures of the view from a dock .
there is a lighthouse in the distance that people can view from boats or the dock .
sometimes birds will rest on the lights .
a speaker allows announcements to be made to visitors .
the trip began at the beach .
in the sand , they found a pretty pink starfish .
they walked along the water to see what else they could find .
the stopped to look at the waves .
so many interesting things to take pictures of !
the beach was a lot of fun yesterday .
i collected so many rocks , seashells , and sea stars .
i combed the entire shore .
we thought about renting one of the boats but we decided not to .
we took man pictures of the ocean while we were there .
today we headed out to the beach .
we spent a bit of time picking up some shells and other things we could find .
after our romp on land we finally headed out into the wave for some fun .
after a bit of playing around , we did some boating .
after the day was done we did a bit of sightseeing to relax .
they decided it would be a great day for a walk out on the beach and they were right .
they saw a few starfish .
they were n't the only ones combing the rocks for pretty shells that day .
still a cool day but it was clear and the water was beautiful .
they took one last look out to the water for any interesting birds before heading back home .
the waves were hitting the shore
and the rocks were pretty .
the people were walking along
and talking
while they took photos .
it says no trespassing ! but we did anyway .
it was fun . we saw a lot like this thing .
the organization even warn us .
but we do n't care . we still went on , and stole some stuff too to see if the organization will keep their word .
then we retired to a lovely little bed and breakfast for the night .
the wp franlin lock and dam site is a very interesting place to tour .
there is much history within the dams here .
if you do not get a tour you can not get up close and check it out .
this is the view from one side of the damn .
there is much greenery in the water by the damn .
well this kind of sign is like an open invitation to someone as inquisitive as me . over the fence i go .
well now , look at this . it is a dam or some secret government laboratory where they 're breeding a super virus to ... yes , it 's a dam .
well heck , another warning . what am i going to steal ? water ? this fence . heck the only thing here worth stealing is this sign ...
so , now that i 've taken that sign as a memento of my visit i think i 'll go check out that bridge . i wonder where it leads .
hmm , well now . a whole bunch of caravans in the middle of nowhere on government land . curiouser and curiouser .
the signs were clearly posted , we just wanted to look .
the dam area was huge and complicated .
another sign warning trespassers , we got the point .
i wonder how much water flows through here every day .
dam is located in a very scenic area , we enjoyed our visit immensely .
my family made me go on a trip to location . organization organization organization organization .
i read about some of the history of the dam and really was n't intrigued .
the coolest parts of the dam were blocked off by fencing .
the water being blocked by the dam was n't even pretty .
i finally did find one area that was visually appealing .
two friends took a road trip to the ocean .
the car 's tires were in good condition , with sufficient thread , to make the trip .
although it was warm , both friends wore long pants .
the beach warned that the hike could be dangerous .
the friends decided to stay on the safer , developed paths .
driving across the ocean side was such a treat for this group of friends .
the water looks so refreshing and the hills are nice to look at .
some areas require caution from rocks falling
but the beautiful scenery is all worth it .
at the end of the day , you will never forget the experience you had and the awesome beauty of nature .
men and some friends took a drive along he coast the other day .
the view from the road was amazing .
the signs said trespassing but thats never stopped us before .
we headed down to the beach for a bit to enjoy the sun .
afterward we hit the road again to find some new adventures .
my friend and i took a road trip up the coast this weekend .
we saw the beautiful areas where the ocean and the land met .
there were areas we had to avoid due to the risk .
the beaches were gorgeous and largely deserted .
the road was wide open , and we had an easy time making the drive .
we drove into the location location location location in location location .
this little guy decided he wanted to hitchhike out with us when we left .
the views were amazing , but so were the drops . here 's my buddy making sure no one went off the edge .
warning signs around the park help keep you in save areas .
the long staircase descending from the top of the park to the tidal pools below . it was amazing .
we took a tour of the local lighthouse today .
we had to go up to the top by climbing these stairs .
almost there - it was a lot of stairs .
finally , the top ! we could see everything from up there .
it was a long climb , but the view was worth it !
this was our lunch right before going out exploring .
a seagull captured right at take off .
some seagulls roosting in a park by the lighthouse .
the inside stairs of the lighthouse by the park .
the outside view of the lighthouse and coast .
we started out the day at the bed and breakfast , eating a hot breakfast made by our hostess .
afterwards , we went out to sight-see . we went to the water 's edge and saw a seagull .
we saw some more seagulls relaxing in the grass .
then we went to the lighthouse and climbed the stairs to the top .
we could see an incredible view from up high ! all in all , we were very pleased with our trip .
this was the entrance of the building .
the stairway spiraled in fashion .
as we got closer to the top , the stairway got more narrow .
we finally reached the top to see the view .
lastly , we enjoyed a view of a town .
i started at the bottom door and went through .
i followed the stairs up .
i was surprised by just how many there where .
when i got to the top it was worth it .
the view was perfect .
our first family trip to location !
we stopped and had lunch on the way .
we could see the beautiful water out the bus window .
the kids were so excited to see the beach .
after the beach it was time to do some shopping .
we had a family trip out to the beach .
then we took a bus ride into town .
the view of the beach from the bus was amazing .
we got into town and chose on a great place to eat .
on the way back , we saw odd things being sold in the windows .
here we are on the bus .
mom and her son smiled for the camera .
check out this view of the ocean .
he 's walking his horse on the beach .
we strolled through town .
we have arrived to our vacation on the beach .
first we stopped to eat lunch .
then we drove to the beach .
after that we walked down to the water .
at the end of the day we walked around the town .
she walked her dog along the beach that morning .
then she went on the bus .
she was going to the other side of the island .
there she would meet her niece .
since she could read well now , she hoped she did n't notice the shit for sale sign because she had just gotten her to stop saying shit .
we had a family cookout for the 4th of july .
everyone brought there own favorite food to form our potluck .
my aunt and cousin are enjoying there food .
after we were done eating we decided it was time for some drinks .
some of us may have had to much to drink !
i had a great time at the party .
my friend invited everyone over . i brought my children too .
i met a lot of his friends .
my son had a great time there .
he eventually got tired and fell asleep .
this is a picture of a family .
this is a picture of a dinner .
a woman is eating corn .
people are drinking alcohol .
people are giving a hug .
everyone got together for the family picnic .
all the food way spread out on the table and looked so yummy .
corn on the cob was the cousins favorite .
the adults were getting tired of drinking coolaid so it was time for an adult beverage .
by the end of the night the little girl was hugging everyone 'night-night '' .
the party was a great time
and had many food options .
they ate corn too
and had many drinks
before they hugged .
it was a pretty foggy day when they left for the beach .
the sun was just barely showing .
there was a pretty clear view of the beach from the hills above it .
as they crossed the terrain the fog seemed to lift .
finally it became a clear day .
the fog sprang into existence .
it wandered through the trees , pondering why it existed .
it traveled to the oceans , but found no answers .
the fog looked high and low for answers .
in the end , it did n't care . it simply decided it would wander the world for as long as it could .
the dusky grey morning beckoned me outdoors .
had it really been an eternity since i roamed these moors ?
the vast landscaped stretched on before me .
`` you are home , '' it whispered to me .
i was home .
i was a really foggy day and we stumbled into a monument yard on our hike .
the monument yard was spooky , so we stayed on the path .
we reached the beach to watch the sunrise .
the cliff was the best place to catch a view .
after the sunrise , the fog started to clear a little bit so we walked closer to the water .

every body is on the ground and having fun with family and friends .
today we had to set up for a public event .
we brought in sand because there was a beach theme .
there was a live band performing . a local group of course .
we enjoyed dressing up and playing in the sane .
there was a nice crowd that came to enjoy the activities .

this cruiseliner decided to stop at this coastal city .
small vacation houses lined the shores for people to sleep in after going to the beach .
geese were common to this area .
some of the townspeople owned boats that they took out on weekeneds .
the geese squawked as the vacationers enjoyed the sights .
i went to dock yesterday to feed the geese .
i spent some time watching the boats while i was there .
there were so many of them .
after that i went back into town to sign see a little bit .
there were many old buildings .
the perfect spot for our family vacation . the water is absolutely amazing .
could not get enough of these cute little houses built into the mountain .
saw a plenty of ducks and sea gulls while we were on the beach .
there is nothing like watching the still waters and people enjoy taking rides out on the water .
the ducks and sea gulls were a big part of our trip , everywhere we were on the beach they were also .
this is a picture of birds .

the boat could be seen in the distance .
our living accommodations were in close proximity .
a lonely duck bravely walked on the shore near some birds .
by the look of things many were taking advantage of the beautiful day .
and the ducks got in on the action too .
`` loo of the year '' at the concert ... interesting .
awesome sign for the surveilance camera .
the cops are ready for any little thing that might go wrong .
concert is starting ! ca n't wait to hear some good music .
end of the show . it was awesome ! ! ! ca n't wait for the next one .
we were really excited to go to the concert last night , that we arrived hours in advance .
we were a little surprised to see policemen on horses , but considering how crowded it was going to be , better be safe than sorry !
we were lucky to have great weather for the show , considering it was an outside concert .
the crowd quickly filled up the space as the show was about to begin . how exciting !
the show went on late into the night and when it got dark , it got even more exciting !
there was a funny sign at our concert venue about the bathrooms .
near the security cameras they had some snark painted on the wall .
the police and security had horses so they could see over the crowds .
there were thousands of people waiting for the show to start .
finally , the show kicked off and it was brilliant .
this is a picture of a field .

this is a picture of outdoors at night .
the city had a big festival
with many concrete walls
and guards on horses .
there were tons of people
and the show ended with fireworks .
they started their trip at the old lighthouse .
the balcony of the lighthouse gave them a good view of other parts of the beach to explore .
once they were back on the ground they decided which side of the ocean to visit first .
they chose a trail through the tropical landscape .
along the trail they went through the natural caverns .
the old light house stood tall and regal .
the ocean water was the deepest blue she had ever seen .
she could see the road that connected to two islands .
she was amazed at the stunning views from the top of the light house .
below , the parking lot looked quite small in her mind .
a couple takes a picture of the light house they visited while on vacation .
when they reach the top of the lighthouse the husband takes his wife 's picture .
she takes a picture of him by a sign on the path .
they follow the tour group down the stairs to see the underground caves .
they take photos of the inside of the cave .
on our yearly trip to the ocean , i found this lighthouse to be so majestic .
i went to the top of the lighthouse to check out the view .
then my husband posed in front of the location location .
next we climbed down to visit the caves .
the inside of the caves was breathtaking . it was a great ending to our trip .
lighthouse tours were a great get away for our anniversary .
the blue sky blended into the ocean waters . we could see for miles .
we walked around the top of the lighthouse and looked at the ocean from all sides . our cars looked so far away .
everyone was taking pictures , hoping to capture the feeling of the vintage lighthouse .
as we looked down at the ground below , we heard the keeper tell of the land and ocean working together to keep the ships and beaches safe .
she loved spending time on the stage .
the drums were just right that night .
she started to dance .
the stage was where she really came alive .
this may have been their best show yet .
we played a gig today .
it was very fun and lively .
we played a lot of songs .
our drummer really got a work out .
it was a very successful gig .
this was the first time i was performing with the new band .
i was so nervous at first .
as we continued my nerves settled and i came alive .
the steady drum beat kept me moving all night .
by the end of the night i was exhausted but a great time was had by all .
today we finally had the pleasure of seeing our favorite local band in concert again .
they started of the night with a bang and really lit of the crowd .
the singer as always was fantastic and really sang her lungs out .
even the more mellow songs were sung fantastically .
they really were full of passion tonight , and i think the fans resonated with that
the lady was having a nice time singing
and the drummer was playing well too .
they danced
while they sang songs
and everyone enjoyed the band .
we took everyone to the playground today .
the slide was a big favorite of the kids .
but the swing was popular too .
they even have a shallow pool for the kids to play in .
they had a great day and want to return soon !
the kiddos playing at the sand table .
[male] trying to figure out how to go down the slide .
mom taking charge and making sure everything is safe .
[male] riding around in style .
mom watch the kiddos like a hawk .
it 's a beautiful day for a trip to the local play park . the kids gets to play and mom gets to relax in the sun .
always the adventurous one , [female] runs straight to the slide . [male] , heads towards something less adventurous , he does n't feel like climbing up there .
yes , this is more [male] 's pace . first time on a swing and loving it .
phew , it 's a scorcher today . thankfully there 's a pool to cool off in . the kids love the water and mom is there to keep a watchful eye .
line up everyone , let 's get a photo . another hard days play is almost done but there 's still time for a little more fun .
the kids are having a great time in the sandbox .
they enjoy sliding on the slide .
after they played for awhile they came and sat on the ground with their mom .
one of the boys rides a bicycle .
mom takes a break with youngest baby while her son plays .
there is a great new playground in town
the slide is incredible
the swing set is a favorite for the kids
they can cool off in the pool
the kids had a blast
we rode out bikes to the beach today .
it was a nice day . the beach was n't too crowded .
the lifeguard did n't have to rescue anyone , thankfully .
we found some bottles that others had left behind .
we found them in a line , so we gathered them up and recycled them .
we used our bike when we went to the beach with our circle of friends .
our referee for the game .
getting ready as a team for our fun game of the day .
this is the concept that we prepare for the game .
and the game starts with this smart man .
we used our bikes to travel to the beach .
there were n't many people that were located here .
a lifeguard made sure swimmers did not drown .
there was an empty alcohol bottle that laid out on the shore .
there were even more bottles that lined up .
we took a 10 mile bike trip to the beach on sunday .
we were thrilled to see it was almost deserted .
[male] pretended to be a lifeguard on the empty beach .
looks like someone forgot to pack up their booze .
the bounty piled up as we went about our clamming .
decided to lounge at the beach today .
was pretty empty besides for us , just the way we like it .
i even got to play lifeguard for a bit !
we brought a lot of bottles . enough to eventually make a game of it ...
how far can the trail go ? we 'll let you know when we finish next time .
we had a great time at the beach , the weather was great .
we built a huge sand castle and relaxed .
the ocean was warm and nice , we went in to our ankles .
at the end of the day we had a big bonfire .
it was nice and warm and we enjoyed the company late into the night .
the friends are playing games on a beach .
some people are just relaxing by the ocean .
after some games they wanted to build a sandcastle .
everyone was enjoying their day out .
the one who made the most complex sand castle won bragging rights .
fun day at the beach playing in the sun .
what 's a day at the each without the kids and sandcastles .
we were contemplating going in the super cold ocean .
so we had a bond fire after swimming .
we settled down and had a few brews . good times !
a family went out to the beach on a nice day .
they built sand castles together .
they did not want to get into the water because it was too cold so they just dipped their feet in instead .
they returned home to start a fire .
they sat around the fire and told ghost stories .
the man was throwing rocks
and was on the beach
when the ladies saw him
by the big campfire
that burned all night long .
the group toured the ruins .
they saw artifacts .
later there was time for diving .
they took another look at the ruins .
then it was time to relax on the beach .
going on a tour through an old city with the family .
wife and daughter taking a break in the center of the city .
one last beautiful look at this wonderful city !
went scuba diving after with my oldest son .
ran in to some friends on the beach did n't realize they were here !
our sight seeing group visited this old village , it was a blast .
here we are running around the ruins , there was so much to see .
the view leaving the city was pretty impressing .
after we went back to the hotel i decided to do some snorkeling .
me and my friends rested at the beach for a few to end the great day .
we took a vacation to location .
we saw some amazing artwork .
then we went scuba diving in the ocean .
after that we visited the aztec ruins .
we ended the day laying out on the beach .
we decided to take a group tour this weekend .
we visited many areas including this ancient building .
it was extremely large and you can tell it was old .
we even went scuba diving !
everyone was tired and ended up relaxing at the beach .
the woman decided to go for a hike along the beach .
on the way , she passed dark stand of trees perched over the sand .
after awhile , it began to rain , so she donned her raincoat .
the walk back was misty , foggy , and full of eerie views .
along the way , she was able to snap a photo of a cool plant .
[female] was on vacation !
it was a beautiful sight out of her hotel window .
she was many different kinds of wildlife growing .
she also went to the beach .
it rained a lot !
i took a trip down to the beach today .
the view over the water was amazing .
then i came across some very interesting plants .
after that the clouds came in over the beach .
it rained for the rest of the day .
i took a selfie and started on my hike even though there was a threat of showers .
walking alone in the woods is my favorite way to unwind .
not completely alone as i came across another hiker smart enough to wear a raincoat .
the misty waters were a peaceful sight .
it stopped showering and the plant life flourished in the sun .
this is me taking a picture on my mini trip .
it was definitely a sight to see as the city was so different from what i was used to .
there were many exotic things including this plant .
unfortunately , the waves were strong that day .
i ended up buying a raincoat because of the weather .
this is my friend [male] sitting on a log , weary of travel .
the trees in the forest were very tall and majestic looking .
there were some small waterfalls , along the path that we took .
[male] is standing on a cliff , with the blue mountains behind , on a distance .
[male] in i put on a tent for our shelter tonight .
a man went on a nature adventure on the location location .
that location provides diverse natural experiences such as the ocean coast .
not far from the ocean are snow covered peaks .
the young man was very satisfied with his experience .
it was a camping experience to remember .
we went camping at a new campground and it was a blast .
these huge trees were jaw dropping . loved the scenery .
we found these awesome waterfalls , cant believe stuff like this is real .
here i am taking a picture on the mountaintop .
we found a good spot to set up camp and wait for tomorrow .
i went hiking in the location with my friend this weekend .
the trees were incredibly tall and seemed to reach up to the sky .
we found a small waterfall where the stream went over the edge .
at the top , my friend posed for a picture in victory .
we went back to our camp , which we placed in the shade of the giant trees .
panoramic view from the campsite this morning . i
the views were breathtaking the whole trip . look how tall these trees are .
lunch break at the falls .
next year we want to conquer that beast behind us .
time to set up for the night . i can not get enough of the scenery .
my friends and i went out for a fun time together .
we stopped and talked to some fishermen .
the sun was hiding behind some clouds and looked beautiful .
we saw a real live bush burner .
later on we found time to sit and relax before heading home .
it was [male] 's bachelor party and they decided to road trip to location .
he brought his groomsmen [male] and [male] .
they tried to be outdoorsy by fishing .
but they ended up not having a clue what they were doing .
so they just bought a meal with some locals .
the three friends were going to spend the day at a beach .
fishermen were busy making sure their nets were in good repair .
they captured a beautiful shot of the sun behind a cloud .
some of the brush accumulating on the beach had to be burned .
one of the friends was happy to relax and watch the waves roll in .
the 3 friends were on their way to go on a trip .
fresh seafood was on the menu for today .
the day was absolutely gorgeous , perfect weather for this time of the year .
they started a bonfire to cook the seafood .
here , a friend is relaxing , taking in the scenery and good weather .
these three men are the best of friends and are having some crazy fun at the beach .
they are learning to create all kinds of things from what they find laying out on the beach .
while taking a break they love to look at the beautiful sky .
to get a little warmer they love to catch some trees on fire , maybe set up a bonfire .
a relaxing second in the boat they are working is a way to sit back and appreciate all the hard work .
i went to the beach to watch the sunset .
everyone was gone and i had the beach to myself .
there was an abandoned boat that i sat in for awhile .
i walked across the dock and sat patiently .
it started getting dark and cold , so i hoped the sun would begin to set soon .
the old man still kept his small boat on the shore by the ocean .
most days though , he sat on the park benches along the walk .
his health was failing but he could still remember the long , beautiful calm days out on the water .
he remembered the stormy days with the threatening clouds looming overhead , too .
though the time and boat seemed now so far away , the old man still loved the smell of water .
it was a picture perfect day
the ocean did n't make a sound
its beauty glistened in the evening sun
it was a sight to behold
another beautiful day and nature 's best
we walked up on the deserted beach just before sunset .
and watched the sun appear over the horizon .
[male] thought about taking out the boat .
but we decided on a walk along the pier .
marveling at gods beautiful creation .
i took my boat out to the beach last week .
there was no one else there .
we had a great time .
the sunset was beautiful .
there were a few clouds in the sky that day .
i went to the party last night .
everyone was getting ready .
we had a live dj there .
at night we had a great time .
everyone was dancing .
the venue for the concert was in a weird area .
[male] had to climb a ladder and jump over a chinese marketplace to get to it .
by the time he got there , it was already rocking .
the singer even crowdsurfed .
the band was amazing , and set the place on fire .
[female] was having fun at the party .
the party was being held to build cancer awareness .
there were bands there .
the bands started playing when it got dark .
everyone had a lot of fun that day .
this is a picture of a woman .
this is a picture of a gathering .
this is a picture of a man .
this is a picture of a stage .
this is a picture of a concert .
a small group of friends goes together to see a concert .
they all congregate at the front of the stage .
the group meets new friends very quickly .
they go inside for a party after the concert .
streamers decorate the ceiling with colorful paper .
when we went to the beach the surf was crashing on the jagged rocks .
a little further down the beach the water calmed .
i had to dip my toes in .
we brought some food coloring and made a colorful sand art centerpiece .
at the end of the day we had a great meal to top off the wonderful day we had .
the tide began to come in and the waves began to lap the rocks .
i caught this picture as the waves began to get higher .
i decided that this shot could also time the water coming to shore .
i was n't the only person who thought that this water rising was photo worthy too .
by the time that the tide was all the way up , the rocks were barely visible .
watching the waves crash against the rocks is so soothing to my stress .
i 'm gon na get in that water .
here i go , gon na dive right in there .
i found a flower while at the water . i wonder who put that there .
time to eat , swimming takes alot of energy .
the water was rough by the rocks .
the beach was deserted .
she enjoyed time alone on the shore .
a sunflower field was nearby .
the sat by the ocean at the end of the day .
this beach is so cool . we had fun exploring the rocks and the little hidden coves .
of course , there were large expanses of sand , perfect for making sand castles .
we walked along the beach , enjoying the gentle sound of the waves rolling in .
something beautiful around every corner .
we ended up having lunch at this open air cafe with a view of the ocean because we could n't get enough of that view .
i went to the beach last weekend .
there was a lot of wildlife on the shore .
the bridge was very old .
the view from the bridge was amazing .
i had a great time there .
the bridge was both magical and scary .
it overlooked cliffs with gently breaking waves .
the image was peaceful and calming .
farther out , the beach could be seen .
it was populated primarily by birds and crabs .
the bridge was large and as high as i had ever seen .
it provided an amazing view of the coast ...
you could look for miles and miles ...
and see beautiful mountains and the waves from a distance ...
we took a final picture and descended ... it was worth the hike .
i went for a hike last night and crossed over a huge bridge .
at the end of the bridge was an amazing view of the ocean .
the grass on the cliffs was bright green .
i saw some puffins swimming in the ocean .
so i walked down to get a better look at them .
looking at a seagull looking for food on the beach .
seagulls in the ocean looking for fish .
i love the bridge , it looks so amazing .
an amazing site from a top the mountain .
an amazing site from the mountain .
yesterday , when i got up , it had snowed on the mountain .
it left mounds of snow on everything .
the whole area looked like a vast tundra .
the top of the ridge was white .
then , when i got into the valley , i realized that only the mountain had the snow .
i went on a trip last weekend .
there was tons of snow .
it was very cold .
i had a great time there .
we set up camp at night .
today i rode on a horse for the first time .
it bucked me off in the snow and left me stranded .
i walked for miles calling for [male] my horse .
i was so tired and had been walking for 4 hours .
i finally came across an area where i could get phone service and called home . i was going to be rescued !
the landscape in the mountains and desert is beautiful .
people come out here and explore the never ending valley .
the sand and how hot it can get is amazing and you can not describe it .
there are few things in the desert so it is hard to know where you are .
if you get lost in the desert it is unlikely that you will survive since it is so hot during the day with no water and really cold at night .
i began my location vacation , that i had been eagerly anticipating , by taking a hike in the mountains .
there was a layer of snow covering the mountains . i was glad i was wearing my new , fleece lined snow boots .
there was a strange structure off in the distance . i never did figure out what it was for .
i followed the path made in the snow . the snow crunched under my new boots as i walked .
and finally i made it to my destination . the perfect spot for a view of the setting sun .
this evening , i decided to watch the sun go down at the beach .
it was a beautiful sight .
while watching it , i walked under the pier .
the trees looked graceful under the evening sky .
i sat out on the beach for awhile just enjoying the beauty before i went back home .
i decided to go for a walk on the beach by myself .
i came across a couple and i got sad because i was alone .
this location reminded me of the movie dear [male] which made me even more sad .
i sat and watched the boats come in the distract myself .
i stayed on the beach long enough to watch the sunset .
i went down to the beach last weekend .
there was some garbage on the beach .
i went for a walk down the beach .
there were some boats in the distance .
the sunset was beautiful .
our day at the beach , the sun was setting .
we watched the sun about to sink below the horizon
the waves crashed against the pier .
the day was ending and it was quite a sight .
we wanted to stay as long as possible
i went for a walk to the beach .
i saw someone sitting and watching the sunset .
next i passed under the pier .
oddly enough , there was a big boat floating dangerously close to the pier , but it looked like they knew what they were doing !
so , i continue on my way and stopped at a nice , quiet place to sit and watch the last of the sun .
all of us decided to go on a spiritual trip .
the religious connections in the area were apparent .
despite how calm it was , the soldiers gave an air of uneasiness .
we still managed to have a very spiritual experience .
all of us felt very close after the trip .
i went on vacation last weekend .
there were a lot of old buildings there .
i had a great time in the pool .
it was next to the ocean .
it was very old .
it is a place of tranquility
where the wood shows it 's age and the colors are faded .
the meditators gather around the reflection pool .
they see far out into the sea , becoming one with the sky .
they find the rough stone of the steps to be a statement about life .
a group of men visited a site with a sculpture of lord ganesh .
nearby , there was an older looking monument that was partly covered with vegetation .
the site had a pool where people could bathe . the pool was guarded by military people .
one of the swimmers paid homage in the water .
the group of men had a good time at the pool
we went to see the amazing articulture of the resort today .
the statues and articulture of the ancient buildings were incredible to see .
[male] wanted expecially to see the stuff by the lakeside , including the pond .
after we saw the sights we went for a dip in the pond .
the whole family joined us there , and we had a great time playing together in the water .
the jeeps and vehicles cruised through the high water .
we parked to enjoy the delicate scenery .
my best friend brought the boating equipment .
we prepared to go boating at a later time .
the scene was so lovely and symbolic of nature .
a group of travelers went on a land expedition to areas not commonly visited .
there were dirt roads which were best handled by true all-terrain vehicles .
the isolated location was beautiful and well worth the difficult travel .
other visitors arrived at the location by boat instead of land .
regardless of how the visitors arrived , the location was full of surprises and intimacy .
the suvs pulled over to the side of the road .
they had arrived at the bay .
everyone got out onto some boats .
they went out into the bay .
everyone loved spending time at the beautiful bay on their boats .
i went on vacation with my car last week .
there was a lot of muddy roads .
when we finally got to the beach it was beautiful .
there were some jet skis there for us .
we had a great time .
we went for a drive along the beach today !
we decided that we would stop and do some walking , though .
the weather was perfect and the water was calm .
we saw a lot of people in boats out on the ocean .
we also found a quiet place , so we decided to stop and have some lunch .
i finally took a vacation to my tropical paradise .
with the blue skies even bluer oceans i could have sworn i was in heaven .
after spending all day hanging around the lagoon i was decided it was time to eat .
i asked my guide and he directed me to an amazing restaurant .
i ate the most amazing meal of my life to the most gorgeous sunset i 've ever seen .
this is the awesome resort we were staying at .
there were many awesome looking buildings on the island .
this one almost seems to be a painting .
lots of beautiful scenery here on this island .
we were sad when we had to depart for home .
while on vacation on a beautiful island , we went sight seeing .
we sailed out into the sea .
when we got to this cove , we went out to walk .
this gorgeous house was on the edge of the trees .
at the end of the day , the sights were worth seeing .
the island the couple was staying on was beautiful .
they could n't have asked for a nicer locations .
the colors of the water and the trees and homes lit up the entire view .
each house they saw was more colorful than the last .
and it was so relaxing and beautiful .
the little villa beckoned us from the boat .
we had a lot of stairs to climb that day !
i thought this looked like a charming painting .
we argued about what this was in the distance .
the scene taken from the rooftop of our hotel .
i went to the beach yesterday .
there were many colorful birds there .
it was a little bit rainy .
there was also a seal .
he was taking a nap in the sand .
i went to the beach and came across many different animals like this bird .
i also found some beautiful flowers .
there were many seals laying on the shore .
there were also many seagulls flying around .
i had the beach to myself and i was able to enjoy nature .
i found a pretty bird with jet black feathers and some bright red ones on its wings .
then i saw this weird looking flower when i heard a strange sound .
where did it come from ? this bored looking walrus !
he 's just watching these birds in the sky .
i watched with it until they flew out of sight .
the bird is having a good time in the water .
sun bathing has to be so delightful .
this flower is so vibrant with color .
the animal looks as if he needs some water .
on his way back to the water he goes .
the wildlife were beautiful to look at .
the flowers out here were not like any we would see back home .
we saw baby seals humbly enjoying the sand .
and pelicans were flying over the sea .
as the sunset the birds began to fly back towards the city
nice sunny day we spent near the ocean.perfect day to relax and enjoy the scenery with my pal [male] .
telescope you could use and view it seemed miles away.i could see birds flying over the ocean .
just relaxing and enjoying the view with [male] .
loved all the varieties of flowers in the nearby fields . some i had never seen before .
these annoying sea gals flew around us the whole time.but it still was a great trip .
i went out for a walk down to the beach yesterday .
it took me a while but when i got there i saw a few cars and people .
i did some sight seeing with the public telescope there .
a lot of other people were there relaxing on the grass .
i took some pictures of the birds and then went back home .
[male] and his friend took a walk down to the harbor .
there on the beach was a telescope that allowed them to see faraway places .
they looked and saw people having a picnic on the beach .
they saw interesting shapes through the tall grass .
and by a white boat at the water 's edge they saw a seagull looking back at them .
we decided to go down to the dike for the day .
we were able to look through this scope and see that little island out there .
the family decided to take a break and just relax watching the shore .
we found these interesting little plants , i wonder what it is called .
there were many birds out and about wanting our food .
the scene at the lake was sparse with people , but beautiful all the same .
at the lake , one could pay to use the viewer which allowed one to see several miles away .
an elderly man and his grandson spent the day recollecting old memories as they made a new one .
the breeze wafted alone , stirring up even the smallest plant in its wake .
there is a diving bird at the lake that is notorious for asking for handouts from the tourists that go there .
this the view from our apartment we rented during our trip to location .
here is my favorite part of the day where i can lounge and and have peace of mind .
i rented a moped in order to visit the locals and do some sight seeing .
here we are getting ready for the club and karaoke .
it was nice when we mingled with another couple from back home .
we went on vacation last weekend .
we did n't rent a car but we used a scooter to get around town .
we had a great time at the restaurants there .
they served great food and drinks . we ate there every night .
me and my girlfriend had a great time there .
our vacation was my husband 's idea , but i did n't mind the island one bit .
we rented these cute little mopeds .
the waterside restaurants were festive and fun .
we settled for dinner at one of them .
one of the waiters took our picture so we could remember our island vacation .
this is a picture of the water .
this is a picture of a resort .
this is a picture of a motorcycle .
this is a picture of a couple .
this is a picture of a family .
this is the view from my new business . i finally have my dream job !
i bought a place on the beach to open my bar .
i have a short ride from home and can take my motorcycle everyday . the fresh air all day is a dream come true .
my wife is my business partner and number one bartender .
we are living the dream and making friends as we do it .
this little girl was bored one day .
she decided to go for a walk along this rocky beach .
she enjoyed looking for shells ,
climbing over the boulders ,
and looking out to sea , imagining all the adventures one could have .
she found a small turtle at the edge of the shore .
her mother told her to put it back in the rocks .
she had on her favorite pink coat .
watching her climb over the large rocks brought a smile to her mothers face .
she knelt down on one rock and proclaimed to her mother that she had named it turtle rock .
on a winter day a little girl in a pink coat went exploring on a beach .
the tide was out leaving many rocks on the shore .
where the waves met the sand , she looked for a few rocks to take home .
she climbed up on a big rock to see further out to sea .
she sat and watched the waves and the sun on the ocean .
ready to do some rock climbing by the beach and playing in the water .
wow , this rock looks a little to far up to climb . better check for something a bit lower .
this is better . the perfect rocks for me , and i can pick them up and toss them around .
oh well , why not give this big rock climbing thing a try .
mission accomplished ! i made it to the top , now let me sit here and enjoy the still water .
it was a chilly day but it was her first time to see this beach area .
the area was a black rocky area instead of the normal sand .
she enjoyed getting the little rocks by the waters edge .
she was enjoying climbing up onto the bigger rocks .
so she could sit and look out at the water .
my first day on holiday was spent at this beautiful beach .
we decided to visit the animal sanctuary and the first thing we saw was this cute koala .
the parrot had the most striking colours and could talk !
the baby kangaroo was very friendly and happy to get a snack from us .
the alligator on the other hand was n't so friendly . we watched from afar as the handler tried to deal with it .
the alligator thinks to himself that it 's about time that he find a prey and starts yawning .
the alligator takes action and approach a poolside area and find it 's target .
a woman in a pool without knowing that an alligator is coming for her smiles towards the camera .
the woman appears to be an adventurous person who is not fearful of dangerous situations such as when she was in a pool while an alligator is approaching her .
it makes one think that the wild can be so dangerous given it 's condition to survive by preying and defending against one 's safety .
[male] knelt in contemplation as to where he would go next on his venture .
he soon stumbled upon this little animal who seemed afraid to let go of the trunk .
but the bird was unhampered by such barriers .
[male] got up close and personal with this zoo 's resident .
soon he saw the trainer enticing the crocodile with his favorite food .
i was invited to visit a tropical zoo .
i saw a cute koala climbing a branch .
this colorful parrot was trying to eat a bug .
i even got to feed a baby kangaroo . so adorable .
what was n't adorable was the crocodile . he was scary !
roll up your pant legs cuz you 're gon na wade deep into the waters our awesome location wildlife sightings !
first up , this cuddly little marsupial clings to a branch , not doing much all day .
believe it or not , these parrots are all over the place , just living wild !
we got up close and personal with the kangaroos .
but none of us wanted to get very close to this fellow !
[male] resting in the hammock on vacation
i pretended i was taller than him in this photo
mom took this awesome photo of the two of us
there were two bridges going into town l
beyond the smoke stacks there are two beautiful ships
[male] doing what he does best , drinking beer and relaxing .
some cannons and cannonballs at an old fort we visited .
a really cool bridge on our way out of the city .
mom 's new horse at the big pasture .
mom , [male] , and [female] together again .
a couple recently went on a vacation and he is hanging out on a hammock .
they visited a bay or a body of water .
they visited the area .
they walked along the sea doing tourist things .
this is one of the things they saw .
the man relaxes on the hammock .
after relaxing he and his wife tour a battlefield .
the large bridge takes them over to a horse ranch .
they admire the horse for awhile .
it is the end of the day and they pose with the ranch hand for a photo .
after relaxing a day after the wedding the new couple left for their honeymoon .
the two were very happy to be on their way .
they got on the boat and started away .
they watched the place get smaller in the distance .
on the boat they passed some interesting places .
the museum had a man-made lake where people could go kayaking .
this man thought it was an interesting addition .
the entire museum had nautical themed installations for the month .
the media was gathered to cover the new pieces .
they all wished they could go paddle kayaks instead .
the had just learned to kayak .
she had chosen her favorite colors of pink and yellow for her kayak .
she listened carefully to her instructor .
her friends got a kick out of hearing her tell of tumbling over on her first few attempts .
much to her dismay , her boyfriend had no interest at all in her new hobby .
seeing the kayakers on the lake made us want to try it .
luckily there wa sa rental shop that came with instructors .
we had to go over the safety stuff before getting started .
mom was n't going , and she expressed her nervousness about us being out on the water .
i was ready to go and could n't wait to learn how to kayak !
[male] paddled across the river for the first time .
it was n't long before he found an old , abandoned dock .
the area had some rather strange statues .
before long , word of [male] 's escapades got out and people flocked to see this strange , new place .
the local kayaking community has grown in size many times as a result .
after kayaking on her own for the very first time , the woman rose her hands in triumph .
near the lake , the brightly colored kayak was ready for the woman to take it on a journey .
after completing her journey , the woman had a chat with local law enforcement .
the woman 's journey was one that would get people talking
the water was cold , and as the woman talked to another , she shivered from the temperature of the water .
near the trees , we rested and talked for a bit .
then we ventured a lovely waterfall .
the flowers around the water were so delicate .
the stream has built such a habitat for the animals .
the stones around the stream were round and heavy .
as we hiked by the mountain we noticed it still has now .
the area around the mountain had many beautiful scenes including this small waterfall .
the local flora was splendid including this pair of red flowers .
we noticed the rocks were smooth and rounded , probably from being in a stream .
although the leaves were gone , these trees were none the less striking .
i went hiking in the hills , the scenery was beautiful .
i found the amazing waterfall , maybe ill go take a dip !
not sure what kind of flowers these were but i had to snap some pictures of them .
followed the stream back home , the water was so calm .
took one last pictures of the rocks on the roadside . this is my favorite hiking spot .
its amazing how even in seemingly warmish weather , there can be snow capped mountains .
the waterfalls are somewhere to visit for sure , they are healing waters .
the flowers are so vibrant and beautiful they do n't even look real .
these rocks are perfect in size and shape like they were sculpted that way by someone .
there are so many trees , when its the spring season i 'm sure it looks like a great wilderness .
we took a trip to a national park . we got to see some mountains .
while hiking , we came to a wonderful water fall .
not too far away we came across some pink flowers growing .
the stones in the area were so smooth and round .
as the sun was setting , we found a group of trees that had no leaves growing on them .
[male] has entered a b & w photo contest to try and win a new camera .
the theme is water so he drove around the bay area to capture various things related to water .
this old lighthouse is still in working condition to warn incoming ships of the danger .
he took this one of an old fishing barge that catches lobsters .
later he went to the woods and caught a good shot of this waterfall and decided this would be his entry .
i went to go visit my grandparents , who always have plenty of food available .
there were lots of family over enjoying beers together .
my grandma personally downed a whole cupful .
next to their house is a beautiful lighthouse .
a few miles away was a lovely waterfall .
this rock formation was very interesting , i was in awe .
we stopped into this pub during the trip . they have some really guinness .
we had to get her another drink , which she said was good to the last drop .
after the pub we came across this incredible lighthouse .
to round off the trip we visited a waterfall . something none of us had experienced before .
this is a beautiful river .
we started out in this boat .
remember to use the lighthouse for direction .
wish we would have had this boat .
but we made it to the waterfall .
have you ever thought about life and all of it 's wonders ?
having a drink with your friends ? are they really your friends ?
is your mom really love you ? or is that why your dad left when you were only three ? was it because she was an alcoholic ?
i doubt you 'll ever know though . why ? because that 's life . always full of certainty .
the only thing certain is that the water will still fall , the sun will rise in the morning and you 'll still be a walking question mark .
a couple woke up early to go to the beach .
they drove to the beach while the morning was still dark .
they arrived at the beach as the sun was rising .
once at the beach they went surfing .
the waves were not at their best , but the couple enjoyed the experience nonetheless .
morning of the last day of our beach trip .
decided to take a walk on the beach and watch the sunrise .
other people had the same idea no wonder morning walks are the best !
wife looking out over the ocean such a great view !
me and my dad on a walk together talking about how we should live here !
the sun was setting and we headed out to the beach for a good time .
we got there before the sun went down and had the whole beach to ourselves .
it was empty for real . the beach went miles with no people in sight .
i decided to dip my feet in the water for a bit , it was freezing .
heres my buds having a talk alone , the beach was great tonight .
my parents and i tried to go surfing early one morning .
we drove to the beach before the sun rose .
on the beach , we found there were only a couple of people there to enjoy the sunrise .
my parents could n't wait to get into the water and sprinted in with their boards .
once in , they started making their way out into the surf .
we left the restaurant but were n't ready to go home .
the sun had just set and there were beautiful colors in the sky .
the ocean is breathtaking at any time of day .
this is my favorite place to meditate as often as i can .
my husband saw an acquaintance and had a chat before we left .
my husband and i rented this little house for a week !
the cute living room , look at that old fireplace !
went on a walk through the woods next to the house .
seflie ! having so much fun here !
collecting some rocks to take back , these have such interesting designs !
i bought a house last month .
my wife and i are very happy with it .
we have a fireplace but no wood to burn .
i started looking for old trees i could cut down for some firewood .
this is the tree i picked .
returned to the childhome for the first time in 15 years .
here i am sitting at the same fireplace i always sat at as a kid .
the old stream is still around . im surprised nobody has built anything over it .
my sister missed me a lot , she wanted to take a selfie .
the rocks aligning the old road are still as smooth as ever . i missed this place .
my girlfriend and i visited a bed and breakfast out in the country .
she took a picture of me in our room next to the fireplace .
we went for a hike along a stream nearby .
we posed together for a picture to commemorate our visit .
the stones we found were very smooth and clean .
we got a new house out in the forest .
we lit a fire in the fireplace .
then we came to a creek in the woods .
we stopped to take a picture .
after that we noticed some smooth gray rocks on the ground .
the woman decided to take her dog to the beach .
as they walked along , they spotted several birds on a pier .
she let her dog run up to the waves , and he ran back as each one came in .
since her dog was well-behaved , she let him run ahead a bit .
during their walk , she was able to snap a great photo of a bird .
it was a good day to take the dog for a walk .
the waves crashed against the pier with a mighty splash .
the dog really enjoyed the walk on the beach .
there were a few surfers out as well .
this bird was flying so majestically .
i am going to the beach with my dog .
it is a little cloudy today .
my dog does n't mind though , he loves the water .
he also likes to run in the sand .
looks like the clouds are clearing up , and some birds are flying around .
my wife and i took our dog down to the sea for the day .
we went right next to the big pier near our house .
our dog loved running on the beach and into and out of the surf .
we saw a man trying to surf in the cold waves .
overhead , a large bird flew , keeping an eye on us as we walked .
[female] took her dog to the beach one cold and dark morning .
they walked under the pier ,
and her dog loved trying to catch the water .
he was being such a good boy that [female] decided to let him off the leash ,
but then he saw a bird and just had to start barking at it like the crazy pup that he is .
there were only a few seagulls , looking for fish and crabs in the water and in the sand .
my sister , [female] , standing by the ocean , on a cold winter 's morning .
there were some caves along the beach , near the ocean .
there are some house 's along the beach , near where we live .
my family and i are taking a break and a drink before dinner .
a great view from the resort .
a nice chilling day on the beach .
the beautiful erected rock .
the resort we stayed in .
afterwards , a few drinks to warm the bones .
we went down to the beach on a cloudy day .
it got cold by the ocean .
then we noticed some large boulders in the water .
when it got dark outside it was time to walk back to the house .
after that we had some drinks with friends .
early morning stroll on the beach , we saw some local birds
weather was quite chilly so no swimming here today
this big sticking out of the ocean was quite a scene to see
i wish i had a house like these , right on the edge of the water
having some shots after a long day
who goes to the beach in location ? we do .
here i am , trying to stay warm while taking in the huge rocks and water .
the locals told us many legends about this prominent rock formation .
our home away from home in location , situated along the beach .
after a day along the freezing water , nothing like a shot of norwegian liquor to get warmed up .
the big blonde dog slept in the doorway of the cabana , dreaming of his lost companions .
they had gotten separated in the hurricane .
he went back to the beach everyday to look for them .
he sniffed all around the shoreline .
occasionally the humans would give him treats , which he gladly accepted .
[male] the cat ,
[male] the lazy dog ,
and brothers [male] and sal
lived on the beach .
they saw people come into their territory and were concerned . but after they talked about it together they decided the humans caused no harm and let them visit their home .
my dog was bored and i knew he wanted to go on an adventure !
when i told him we were going to go on a trip , he got very excited ! we stopped and picked up two of his doggie friends .
first we went to the park , but after a few minutes of running around we decided to try something even better .
we went to the beach ! he loved the waves and playing in the water .
we met friends and decided to come back next weekend , too !
this is [male] a lab mix resting at a shelter in location location .
jinxie and location are just meeting for the first time as a possible new forever home for location .
outside there is a large area for running .
they even have a private beach to go swimming .
this man is passing out information about the shelters 1/2 price adoptions in the following weeks .
[male] took a break whie we prepared to leave .
jojo and truffles were excited about the trip .
here is a view of the beach and the apartment building we stayed in .
the waves were quite large and powerful .
a family is having an argument on the beach .
picture of our house up on the hill from the beach.the first one on the left.not a very far walk for a beautiful days relaxing moment .
decided to take a walk down the beach and just enjoy myself .
there is this fence in the middle of the beach.i am not sure why it is here , but it seems to help with when the tides come up.traps all the seaweed .
want to catch some tasty fish ? walk all the way to the end of this rocky pier and you will get a fight of your life.but it sure pays off at dinner time .
some interesting beach art in my backyard. got ta love beach life .
we went to the beach today .
it was very sunny outside .
we had a lot of fun walking along the edge .
there was a lot of things to see .
it was a very fun day .
today we went to the beach to search for seashells .
my friend wanted me to take a picture of her while we were there .
on one end of the beach we saw this fence .
we kind of got sidetracked from shell hunting by walking on these rocks .
we also saw this eagle statue , but i 'm not sure if it was vandalized .
the ocean has been dissipating off the coast for years now .
from it we got a lot more beach .
enough beach to actually walk on . this used to be all water .
the fence used to indicate deep water but now just looks like a normal fence .
you could even see boats once sunken on the shore .
it was a beautiful day to spend at the beach .
the young one enjoyed walking with her feet just in the water .
they wondered why someone would put a fence up half way between the dunes and the shore .
they found a rock pier and walked out to see if anyone was fishing .
while exploring they found this unusual statue .
the weather was perfect for flying a kite .
she wore her sunglasses and joked that she was a shady character .
the sun felt warm against her back .
she took her flipflops off and walked barefoot on the pebbled beach .
soon , a few other people were flying kites along with her .
we went to the beach today .
we enjoyed walking on the dock and checking out the view .
we did some wading in the water .
we watched the surfers .
we got to fly kites today too .
[female] is the best time of the year . it is the perfect time to visit the beach and watch people try to fly kites .
sitting here watching the sea gulls and still waters .
think it is time for a walk along the beach . maybe there will be a new sea shell discovery .
leaving my flip flops behind , so that my toes can feel the sand .
there is nothing better than finding a group of friends to share the day with on the beach .
heading to the beach on this beautiful day .
my girlfriend is so happy to be here .
is n't she beautiful walking along the sand like that ?
who wears shoes to the beach ? barefoot sand is so much more awesome .
watching people fly their kites , we 'll havta bring one w/ us next time .
[male] was very excited about kiteboarding for the first time .
it was a perfect , clear day with high winds .
mom was very proud of [male] for trying out his new kiteboard .
[male] got up first try , and even made a big jump .
as he glided along the bay , several other kite flyers came out to enjoy the winds .
i had trained all month for the bike race .
i was finally read to go . the race was today !
there were a lot of people watching the event .
there were even more people participating .
it was going to be a long race .
the day of the location to location location location had arrived
i took a selfie while waiting at the starting line .
this is my friend [male] who thinks he will be faster than i will .
my friend [male] decided to join us for moral support . he is n't racing because of a last minute injury .
there are so many people here to race , i hope i finish in a respectable place .
heading to the bike race . wonder if i will be able to finish .
really worried about finishing the race . however , i think i can .
look at all the people gathered to watch the bikers .
oh it is getting rather crowded down here . [female] my family made it .
[female] people will read about the bike ride so they will know just how far we bikers are traveling .
going to do the location to location location location today !
getting ready in the parking lots .
my buddy is tired from the ride .
my other friend is tired from the long ride
look at all those people here to cheer us on !
team 'we do n't want to do this ' were very intimidated by the course map .
[male] 'mr accountant ' crenshaw took a selfie before before starting his leg .
[male] 'ice cold ' pendergrass was next up , frightened and ready to go .
bringing up the last leg was [male] 'stinky foot ' jones , and he was terrified .
the team did not manage to finish this day . but they did manage to catch a bus to the race party .
the town had such a quaint feeling to it .
the ocean side views made it look so fresh .
the city itself looked like it was straight from a movie .
we arrived at the hotel in anticipation .
it was n't as nice as expected , but good enough .
having just arrived in the big city ,
i checked into the motel i booked on the internet .
it was not exactly as nice as i had expected .
i decided to make the best of it and take a short nap before heading out .
afterwards , i took a walk along the water .
we were visiting the city to meet some relatives .
to save money , we stayed at this hotel .
the inside of the hotel looked better than i imagined it to be .
the beds were pretty comfortable too .
the hotel was pretty close to a dock , which was pretty nice .
finally made it to the vacation spot .
getting ready to take a walk along the beach .
a picture of the big city where we are spending our vacation .
love the door with the light house you do n't see these often when traveling .
resting up before hitting the streets again tonight . love being on vacation .
one morning she decided to get out of the city and get to the water for a weekend .
she decided to stay at organization 's .
the lobby area looked dated but that was okay because she did n't plan to spend much time in the lobby .
they only had rooms with two beds left .
before the day was over she finally made her way down to the water for some relaxation .
[male] , [female] , and alecia took the day to explore their new town .
they played a game of ping pong and did horribly .
then they took a wade in a kiddie pool .
[male] found a quaint indian restaurant for them to try .
then they all took a horseback ride down the river .
i brought my family with me on vacation last week .
we had a great time out exploring other countries .
there were many people walking around on the streets .
we saw a lot of unique shops and restaurants while we were there .
we even stopped to play table tennis with some of the locals .
the whole family 's here now !
[male] plays a game of ping pong with each family member .
after the game , we cool off in the pool .
each family member has lunch before taking on the next adventure .
riding the horses and stopping to let the horses have a drink in the creek .
my siblings were looking forward to the family reunion .
there was table tennis , my brother 's favorite .
and a kiddie pool filled with balloons for the `` kids '' that my brother and sister could n't resist .
dad was in charge of the grill , and we ate good !
a horse and rider came by for a drink of water , we offered the horse some veggies and the rider a burger .
the family spent the day doing outdoor activities .
my brother wanted to play ping pong .
i wanted to swim in a pool but i was misled to think the pool was for adults .
we ate lunch instead because we were famished .
and there goes my dad riding a horse into a river .
i captured this beautiful mallard at the park today .
i was surprised to see many rabbits in the park today .
the rabbits were n't even afraid to come near you and say hi .
on the left side of the lake we can see skyline of the city .
here is a person taking advantage of this day while enjoying himself .
a duck meandering around the lake the other day .
a fluffy bunny munching on the grass at the park .
a man parasailing right next to a boat on the lake .
sunset looking away from the city .
the mountains at sunset overlooking the lake .
i went to the park yesterday .
there were many animals there .
i got to feed some of them .
i had a great time at the park .
there were some people wind surfing .
a mallard duck relaxes in the cool pond water .
a rabbit watches the duck interested .
a young rabbit approaches a man that was sitting on the park bench .
from the outside the park looks busy and beautiful .
it is located right near the bustling city and the ocean .
the duck was on the lake
while the rabbit was eating .
the skyline was pretty
as the sun went down
over the boat dock .
not far away from their home stood the old lighthouse .
every now and then they would still go there , remembering days gone by .
they walked on the sandy beach almost daily .
now they stayed in their summer home year 'round .
often they would get the jon boat out and fish along the shore .
our family went camping near the beach this past weekend .
it was n't too rough . we had a nice spread of food .
i enjoyed napping in the hammock .
the beach area was beautiful , and we loved walking in the sand .
the beautiful sunset was a nice end to a lovely day .
we decided to take a family camping trip .
we got the campsite set up in a flash .
we got it done so quickly there was plenty of time to relax .
we visited the local beach .
we stayed until sunset taking and playing .
we found the lighthouse we had been looking for on our vacation .
we were excited to reach it and stopped for a photo .
the beach was stunning .
we walked a little farther and found a lodge .
the lodge had boat rentals , so we rented one .
the family all met up for some camping .
we set up chairs and tents . it looked good .
we lazed around a bit before heading out .
we came up to a beach and decided to walk down to it .
we stood there and watched the sunset . it was amazing .
the day started out with a nice stroll on the beach .
[male] and [male] started building the moat for the castle .
they had some help building the castle .
the end castle was awesome .
the day ended with a nice fire by the water .
the marginal way sign .
arriving at the beach
seagull looking for dinner .
ducks swimming in the water .
waves forming and crashing on rocks .
the trip to the isolate shore was peaceful .
we walked from one side of the shore to the others and the rocks were part of the lake 's beauty .
we walked up a hill and looked down the rocky slope
back to the shore on the bottom .
overall it was a beautiful trip especially as we walked towards the more forest like area away from the shore .
a day by the water , look how big the river rocks are .
this is a beautiful view of the water very calm and peaceful .
i did n't want to climb down and hurt myself so i 'll just stand here and look .
next time we will find a way out on the water and have a day of it , but it 's so calm and serene .
the trees should be greener since it 's by the lake however the are huge .
when walking down to the beach we came to a plaque in the ground .
we passed through the trees to get to the beach .
then we saw a seagull flying over the ocean .
after that we saw some ducks swimming in the water .
we watched as the waves washed over the rocks .
i had a great time on vacation last weekend .
the sunsets were amazing from the beach .
they changed the entire color scheme of the sky .
i watched the sun go down completely .
back in town the sun changed the color of all the buildings .
we arrived at night to our campsite , and had n't explored the area . we were in for a treat .
we took this path and stairway . it was constructed of well worn wooden planks .
the path led to the ocean . we caught a glimpse of the beach . the sign warned us to stay away from the cliffs .
this marker was made by pioneers almost two hundred years ago .
this was our reward at the end of a long hike . what a beautiful place .
a young couple took a trip to the beach to watch the sunset .
they watched people walking down the beach below them and the boats off in the distance
they sat on a wall and watching the sun start to drop .
there was a lot of really old things sticking up out of the water .
the sun set behind an old pier making the sky a beautiful assortment of colors .
view across the lake , you can see the bridge in the center .
the sunset makes beautiful pattern across the water .
this is a closer view of the bridge from where we were standing .
it 's amazing to see the beautiful goldenrod flowers growing on the rocks .
this bird is the king of his roost !
the choppiness of the lake made every rock and passing driftwood look like something out of a legend .
when the light hit the waves just right it sometimes looked like metal .
some of the lake goers liked to walk across the boardwalk and throw pebbles into the drifting waters .
on the beach there were a collection of different creatures , especially the plant life and crustaceans that made it their home .
on a building , a lone seagull began to caw wildly as the smell of fish filled the air .
the beach we stayed at while we were on vacation was gorgeous .
it was a sandy white beach with many huts on the shore .
the water was a beautiful color .
there were some other people there on vacation as well .
we had a great time .
vacation started early by directly going to the beach .
we took our seat and sunbathed for the whole morning .
we sometimes go to the bar to get some liquor .
the kids had a blast simply by exploring the beach .
my wife posing for me on this paradise island .
the beach was gorgeous last weekend .
the people who were under the shade offered us beers .
the tide came in while we were relaxing , bringing in driftwood and seaweed .
a man we 'd watch dig for clams walked by and did n't say hi .
my sister wanted some pictures for her instagram to prove she was at the beach .
a perfect start to my caribbean vacation- blue skies and clear , calm , seas .
a little shade and a time out from the sun at the tiki hut ; maybe i 'll order a pina colada .
i feel like i 'm on my own private beach ; not a soul in sight , but where are the sea shells ?
a local man with very long hair strolls by my lounge chair ; i wonder if those are hair extensions .
i 'm going to miss this beach ; at least i 'll go home with a nice tan .
spending today at the beautiful beach by our hotel .
there 's a bar just behind us , i hear they have really good drinks .
watching the waves roll in under a beautiful sky .
this guy seemed super out of place . i feel like a creeper taking this picture .
my beautiful new wife posing against a beautiful ocean .
i love the beach .
natural formations like this are beautiful .
this is a natural cave .
while at the beach we check out all the wildlife .
we also have a boat we take out on the water .
for the weekend we drove to the lake .
we saw lots of wildlife while we were there .
there were many things to do there , kayaking was fun .
while exploring we found a cave .
it was a great weekend with friends .
ah it 's so beautiful here . this is where dad proposed to mom all those years ago . what a great place to spend an anniversary .
it sure is beautiful here , but do n't let the blue skies fool you , it 's pretty chilly out . look how empty the beach is . it 's certainly not sunbathing weather . mom poses by the big rock with dad behind the camera . that 's right , suck that belly in !
the pair hide out in a natural cave to get out of the wind for a while . arm in arm after all these years .
i wonder what they 're talking about . it looks like a pretty intense conversation . hey , maybe it 's another proposal . how cute !
well , it looks like the spirit of adventure has n't left these two . mom and dad take off on a kayak reliving their youth .
we took our first trip together to the beach . i loved it so much .
i did n't expect to see so many trees and rocks so close to the beach .
after all these years together it 's amazing that this was the first time we 'd gone to the beach .
these birds reminded me of us . they look so in love !
[male] got me to try kayaking . i actually loved it !
the family and friend decided to go to the lake .
the birds were enjoying the weather too .
the two friends got on the water and kayaked for awhile .
then the couple and friend went into the caves .
the three had a glorious day .
i was surprised at my house by my girlfriend .
she took me out to eat at a pizza place .
then we went to the beach and i caught a great picture of her .
we took a selfie together .
at the end of the day , we left the beach with out footprints in the sand .
[male] loved trying new foods .
he was glad he vacationed in such a good place for foodies .
he wanted to try everything on the menu .
after lunch everyone went on a picnic .
on his way home [male] started to get a stomach ache .
it was his first time trying this dish .
the menu had plenty of tasty items listed .
i pulled my hair back before getting into the water .
our first vacation pic together !
our footprints in the sand .
the food in this restaurant near the beach was incredible !
there was no shortage of options for pizza on the menu .
my girl is more beautiful than the ocean !
taking a beach vacation with my lady was a great idea .
all we are leaving behind are footprints , but we are taking away many memories .
before taking a trip to the beach we stopped for lunch .
the restaurant had many different types of pizza .
we got to the beach on such a nice day .
then we stopped to take some pictures to remember our trip .
after that we saw the white sand by the water .
we went on our honeymoon to the location .
the beaches were amazing and the weather was nice .
we visited the harbor on our walk and saw many boats .
the countryside was really green and amazing .
the roads were a bit scary for driving , but we got used to them . we will be back for sure .
though i knew location was an island , i somehow did not expect ports here .
there are cliffs beside the sea .
everywhere i look is green .
the roads wind back and forth up the mountainside .
there , we encounter a flock of sheep on the road . now , that side of location i 've heard of .
i went to location last weekend .
it was an amazing time . the view from my hotel room was breathtaking .
walking in the fields around the hotel was a dream come true . the landscape spoke to me .
i walked for miles . the scenery just kept getting better .
i finally walked so far that i was lost . a large truck picked me up and started driving me in town . i do n't know where we 're going and i 'm kind of scared .
we headed out to the local beach .
the area was very secluded .
every direction around us seemed empty .
we climbed up on to the hill and headed back out .
we got to the road and the adventure continued .
our honeymoon destination was a wedding gift .
my in-laws are very generous and have great taste .
this was the most beautiful place i 've ever seen .
the weather was perfect for the entire week !
sometimes we felt we were in a different century . it was quite an experience .
the johnson family took a vacation to location excited to experience some sun .
unfortunately location had been having a lot of rain .
the johnson 's put on a happy face and tried to make the most of it .
but they were regretting not going to location .
the next day proved that their patience paid off , it was 90 degrees and beautiful .
a family went to the ocean .
they took many pictures together near the water .
they were amazed at how gorgeous the scenery was .
they were surprised to see a goat on the land .
they had the entire place to themselves to swim and explore .
[male] and his wife [female] made a beach trip today .
they brought along one of their friends [female] enjoyed the day .
the scenery was beautiful and everyone enjoyed .
the even ran into some wildlife common in the area .
it began to clear up a little later in the day , which made it much more enjoyable .
[male] and [female] went out to hang out on the beach .
the water was very calm today and it was a cool day .
they met up with [male] 's sister [female] and talked for a while .
[female] invited her boyfriend to come hang out with all of them .
they enjoyed a beautiful nice day on the beach .
she was his first wife and only legal wife .
they had a plural marriage .
her sister wife had never been to the beach .
this was her honeymoon .
she loved the beach .
there was a great sunset at the beach today .
it was very beautiful .
i stayed there for hours admiring it .
i had a great time there .
it was a lot of fun .
we went to the beach to take some pictures of the sunset .
we got there right in time to take pictures .
the sun reflects on the ocean and colors the sky red .
we loved seeing the sun drop into the sky .
it 's like the pictures you see in a storybook .
we traveled around capturing different sunsets .
many of them looked the same with different lighting .
this sunset was ideal for a romantic dinner .
this sunset was the perfect backdrop for a wedding .
the location seems still at this time of day .
on our final night of vacation we decided we 'd sit on the beach until sunset .
it was quiet , serene , as most people had packed it up and headed home for the day .
i thought the kids would get antsy sitting around with us , much to my surprise they loved it as much as me !
[female] made sand castles while mommy had a glass of wine .
finally the moment we had been waiting for , watching the sun disappear behind a wall of ocean , so gorgeous , i 'm not ready to go back to location !
the beach was a bit crowded but still lovely .
the horizon looked gorgeous in the distance .
the sun fell slowly into the sea , treating us all to a radiant view .
it was a once in a lifetime view of the sunset and the ocean .
this picture was my favorite .
today , i made it a goal to learn how to surf ! here i am getting comfortable on the board .
i am watching for the waves . sometimes it takes a while to find the perfect wave !
i decided to go for this wave . that was not a wise decision . the wave and i fought , and the wave won !
here i am trying again . i first have to swim out to the waves . i am still determined to meet my goal .
waiting for the wave is very time consuming . but , i know it will be worth it in the end .
[male] went to swim at the beach .
he was training to become a professional surf boarder .
he was so incredibly focused that day on just his training .
there was little time to relax on the beach [male] spent most of the day in the water .
training to become the best he could be .
went out surfing with my bros .
[male] is still pretty knew and is trying out surfing .
here he is practicing on smaller waves .
he 's getting a lot better at swimming on the board .
[male] is pretty tired from practicing so we 're gon na go grab some smoothies and head out .
perfect day to learn to surf .
ok , i '' m sitting on my board , now what . this is boring .
oh no , i see now here i go .
that was pretty cool . surfing is fun .
here comes a huge wave .
my son went surfing .
he seems pretty good at it .
his friends joined him .
we had the beach to ourselves .
he did n't get up on his board in time . we all laughed about it later .
i went to the beach last week .
i took my wife with me .
we spent hours there .
we had a great time .
i also purposed to her there .
the engagement is official .
they let everyone know through photos .
the love they show is so sweet .
they have such romance about them .
it will be a love of a lifetime .
today was the day we got to take language with photos .
we decided on a beach location .
it was so much fun and i felt even more in love with my fiance .
our photographer did a great job and took amazing photos .
you can not wait to mail them out and share the good news with everybody .
[male] and suzy want to the beach .
they walked along and had a good time .
the sun began to set .
so , they set down together .
[male] proposed to suzy . she said `` maybe , '' and took the ring .
we are together and about to go on an amazing journey !
we have fun walking along the peaceful shore .
two people in love sitting in the sand .
having the time of our lives just the two of us !
we had such an amazing and wonderful time together !
they pulled up onto a deserted island .
they found something strange buried in the sand .
the jungle went quietÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ .
a strange creature emerged !
it tossed them into the sea and they were never seen again .
when we went to the beach today the oddest things happened .
when we first arrived we took a swim .
then we found the largest shell i have ever seen .
but what was really weird was there was the lone white brahman bull laying in the sand sleeping .
we decided that was our cue to leave this mysterious place . so we hopped in the boat and sped away .
i went on vacation last week .
i was on an island .
the island was beautiful .
there was sand everywhere .
i ca n't wait to go back there .
stranded on the beach . i could n't think of a better place to be until i start getting hungry .
hey , this is a turtle . this is cool . he buried himself .
i could build a little hut right about here with 3 bedrooms and 2 bath .
uh , this is a cow , is he stranded here too . got milk ?
this will be my tub .
low tide always left things behind .
was it dead ?
shells were easier to find .
remnants of a sand sculpture remained .
high tide would take it all back out to sea .
the accommodations on our mission trip were not what we had really expected .
the daily transportation also left some room to be desired .
the special ferry we took down the river to see the city was very pleasant and comfortable .
the city was much different than the location of our mission trip , nice buildings and structures .
the historic organization organization was a sight to behold , even in the daylight . riding it at night on the last day was definitely a high light .
our river boat trip was a lot of fun .
we went down the river and saw many attractions .
the boat was full but that made it even more fun .
even though the water was not blue , we had a great time .
we saw other people and interesting boats on the whole ride down the river .
we 're heading toward the boat ride !
along the shore , a carnival is busy with activity .
here we are on the boat ride , taking in the local scenery .
here 's a view from one side of the boat .
nearby , we saw this boat with a lot of stuff on it .
our family took a vacation to an amusement park by the lake . we stayed in a house and used a boat for transportation .
i loved riding the ferris wheel it was my absolute favorite thing to do .
we would take rides on the ride along boat and hear fun stories about the park .
we would sit outside and look at the trees across the lake .
we even took the ride along boat to the trees and drove through them .
quarters might have been cozy , but the fun we had made it all worthwhile .
even muddied waters could not curb our enthusiasm during the boat rides .
with something interesting seemingly at every turn in the river , cameras were perched , ready to snap a memorable pic .
blues skies prevailed during our stay , as the waters gradually receded to make for an enjoyable respite from the hustle and bustle of the city !
the boat rides took us on a nature journey , while all the time there was the excitement of the amusement park just a dock away .
a couple decided to be dare devils and go out on a volcano .
they were extremely scared , but they were impressed at themselves for achieving it .
once they got passed the scary part , they were able to see a beautiful area .
they had to breathe in a lot of smoke .
once they got off the volcano , they came across a sculpture .
the mist began to rise from the structure .
soon it surrounded the large lagoon .
fortunately we were able to walk fast enough to the small lagoon before the mist caught up .
but soon it made it 's way over to this area too .
upon leaving i took a picture next to the statue near the front entrance .
we toured a volcanic area while on vacation .
it was near water , and there was red algae from the minerals in the ash .
my boyfriend and i loved the nearby warm spring pool .
at one point , it was so smoky we could n't see much .
later , we found a cool statue that was lord of the rings like . it made us act silly .
we passed some caverns on our walk .
we where careful not to disturb anything along the way .
we stopped at a hot spring and relaxed a bit .
the steam was everywhere !
we left but made sure to have a little fun on our way out .
my girlfriend and i decided to visit a hawaiian volcano while on vacation .
it was cool enough for us to get really close to the lava flow .
my girlfriend and i had the guide take a picture of us near an open geyser .
after a while though things started to heat up and margrett was surrounded by steam .
after visiting the park we stopped at the entrance so she could pose with a gargoyle .
the lounge was comfortable .
we explored the gardens .
there were neat things everywhere .
you could see the town off in the distance .
the family was so welcoming .
lots of great scenery on our vacation .
a nice pathway leading away from our hotel .
lots of culture nearby .
a very interesting monkey statue .
also the rental cars are very small here .
we arrived to have dinner at the lovely restaurant in the outskirts .
it was attached to our hotel and was really convenient .
except for the weird statue outside !
we then wondered around the field after dinner to walk off the meal .
and , took a final family photo before we left .
the dinning hall is set for a beautiful ceremony .
the building was hand built around beautiful trees .
this statue stands outside of the building for donations .
there is a track that leads to the building in a big field .
a family awaits there guests for the big ceremony .
on our vacation we ate at many nice restaurants .
the place we stayed at was a great hotel .
we got to see many different statues like this monkey .
walking around the park area was my favorite part .
being there with my whole family was really a blessing .
we went to the beach today .
i finally stopped raining .
we went to party .
then we had something to eat .
it was a fun time .
i was on a boat .
it was near other boats .
we floated down the river .
then under a bridge .
one guy was covered in mud !
it was cold and rainy when we arrived on the island .
the next day was clear , so we took the boat out to watch the locals on the water .
that night , we went to a local bar .
we could n't resist a bit of home from an oddly familiar looking fast food place .
the last day , we hiked up the way and found a secluded beach .
he decided to get away from the dreary day to day he 's used to .
off to a fun tropical island getaway !
it was easy for him to find a party just about every night he was away on the island .
he was n't homesick for fast food either since there was a hungry jacks on the island .
time to get back to the airport to head back home .
there is a dock overlooking the water .
there were two men on the dock looking at the water and buildings .
the buildings were large and there were trees .
there was a big bridge that went across the water .
nearby , on the sand , a man was having a mud bath .
today i went to the beach to take photos for my photography class .
there were not many people out , so i focused on the nature .
there were many seagulls posing for me nearby .
right before i left a quaint little boat silently cruised by .
of all the photos i took today , my favorite was this one of a simple mussel shell .
a couple toasted to a nice vacation .
the couple were joined by older relatives .
the family members went out on a tall-mast boat .
afterwards the family explored the beach and the surroundings .
next to the beach , they found a cemetery where a notable person with the title of president was buried .
i went to visit a lovely seaside town this weekend and had my picture taken .
no one was on the beach except for some gulls .
one intrepid gull waded into the surf to see what he could find .
a nearby fishing boat was the only sign of other humans .
a small shell had washed up on the shore , and i took a picture of it .
a champagne toss for the camera .
grandparents enjoyed boating , and this was overall a fun day .
we saw a manatee and everyone was trying to get a closer look .
not many beach goers and the water was freezing .
tombstone of a past president .
[female] looks beautiful in this light .
our friends the seagulls were following us the whole walk . i think they thought we had food .
seagull deep in thought .
this would be the live . that it i want a sail boat .
found this pretty shell . might frame this picture for the bathroom .
i used my computer to find some products online .
the first product i found were some brown shoes .
i also had been looking for a guitar so i bought that online too .
for dinner , my wife made pasta .
before the sun went down , we ate and relaxed in the grass field .
did n't know what i should today , but knew i needed some fresh air .
i decided to go for a walk .
i first saw this sign for a round a bout which i had never seen before .
then i saw a sign to keep out . somehow the blue sign didnt seem very convincing .
the best part of the walk was thisnadorable little dog i saw .
my friend [male] decided he needed to get out more .
he and i went for a walk around the city , and took pictures as we went .
we saw a roundabout , which was unusual in this part of the world .
we found a place we could n't enter , which tempted us to keep going .
however , we saw a cute dog nearby that made everything better .
mom looked at photos on her computer .
i opened up my new pair of shoes that i have been waiting to wear .
dad got out his guitar and shared it with us .
we went out to eat for some delicious spaghetti !
later we took a ride in the car and checked out some beautiful scenery .
i was cleaning my apartment and found some pictures on my laptop .
then i found my brown shoes .
i found a place to put my new sticker .
after that i cooked spaghetti for lunch .
when i was done i took a trip through the country side .
here [female] debating whether or [female] going for a swim .
me and the kids decided to spend the day on the beach .
here they are deleting the photos that did n't seem acceptable for them .
here is [female] again jumping and wanted to attract attention .
here is [male] trying to look athletic and jittery .
one day three sisters went to the beach .
they took selfies to show their friends on social media .
it was very windy that day .
so windy that the girls had a hard time keeping their scarves from blowing away .
later that evening , they enjoyed telling everyone of their adventures at the beach .
i brought my little girl and her friends to play on the beach .
they found some interesting looking shells in the sand .
my daughter 's friend wanted to wear her new cultural garments .
she had some well designed scarfs and whatnot .
back home my wife was happy to see the girls after a long day at work .
[female] was very excited to tell her mother about the huge dolphin she saw in the water .
and even better , her friends were there to corroborate the story .
her friend [female] was quick enough to take pictures as it jumped up .
[female] was so excited about the dolphin that she felt like dancing in the sand .
and then her friend joined her ! it was a great day .
hello , we 're here !
let 's share our photos together .
it was windy on the beach .
i had to hold my shawl tightly so the wind would n't whip it away .
it 's too windy , so we 'll have fun inside .
the campfire was warm .
everyone gathered around the warmth to share songs and stories .
wood kept getting added to the fire over the course of the night .
sharing time in front of a fire brought back childhood memories .
everyone was happy to be spending this time together . the glowing fire kept spirits high .
our family had a blast on vacation !
we toured the local attractions in the morning .
we stopped for drinks in the afternoon .
many photos were taken to post on social media .
we even attended a bonfire on the beach one evening .
started the day off w/ breakfast w/ the family .
then we went to a museum down the street .
had a few drinks during lunch .
making memories w/ my cousin .
ending the night right , a giant bon fire w/ the family i love .
every one got together for dinner .
at dinner , there was an interesting mural on the wall .
everyone looked and it and talked about it .
the smiled and took pictures with it to remember it .
after dinner , they decided to have a bonfire to end the night .
the friends were all gathered at the bonfire .
they decided to chat for awhile .
they added more sticks to make the bonefire really roar .
he was having a grand time enjoying all the company .
they were wondering who was going to get the marshmallows .
i chose to go here for vacation after receiving this postcard .
our hotel over looked the city .
the city lights were very pretty .
the hotel had a tropical courtyard .
the beach we went to looked just about like the postcard .
today we decided to go out on the town to find a new place
we looked around and saw a lot of apartment buildings . but we wanted houses .
the houses were all very fenced in that were near the coast
i wanted a view that looked a bit more like this for our house .
i suppose we will come back tomorrow and look at places again
i went on vacation in a tropical paradise and took pictures of my trip .
from my room , you could see the buildings of the city stretch out before you .
the buildings looked especially lovely at night .
on the ground , the palm trees and tropical plants were everywhere .
the beach was quite beautiful , especially at sunset .
the courtyard was empty at the boarding school . morning bells rang to signify the classes but no one came .
all of the buildings were empty of the children that usually filled the halls .
it did n't look like the children had tried to escape by jumping the walls .
checking the places that they kids usually liked to play came up nothing .
all over the city the parents searched for their children . it was a mystery . no one ever saw the kids again .
paradise for [female] was living on the beach .
she loved that her apartment was close to downtown , but still on the quiet beach .
she loved watching the city lights light up the night ,
and she loved watching the beautiful trees line the peaceful beach .
yeah , her apartment was in paradise .
a fire performer was at the beach last night
he was amazing in how he made designs out of fire .
he moved so quickly . it was like watching the fire dance .
although the flames would get close to his body , he never got burned .
for the finale , he created this huge spiral of fire . it was quite a show !
at parties sometimes people throw fire .
it looks dangerous .
people that are trained firethrowers usually know what they 're doing .
it 's important for the crowd to stand back .
when people are throwing fire it can be mesmerizing .
there was a performance on the beach .
one person lit up the torch .
later , a woman twirled the sticks in the air .
they used very rapid motions .
lastly , this was a design that was created by the performer .
a performer was trying to find a talent they were good at .
they decided to try fire art .
they found out that it was harder than they imagined it was .
they were unable to create creative designs .
they gave up once they almost burned themselves .
the luau i went to on saturday feature a fire dancer .
he treated the fire sticks like they were simple little sparklers .
some of the fire tricks were n't that impressive .
other tricks were a little bit more interesting .
however , by the finale i was so wowed that i wanted to see the show again .
the guys prepared for their trip .
they were cold and wished they 'd brought heavier coats .
they warmed up by sliding on the ice .
ouch ! that hurts .
then it was time to head home .
my friends and i needed a break from work so we packed the car for a trip .
it was a long drive to lake but the scenery made it worthwhile .
my friends liked the mountains and the snow .
it was a little slippery to get to our cabin , but we laughed about it and had fun .
the restful views were just what i needed to take a break from work .
time to get ready for a nice trip .
it is snowing outside , but it is still nice .
we are all going to try some sledding on this hill .
it is n't very steep so it is not dangerous .
time to finally end our day , and drive home .
my friends and i took a road trip this winter in my friend 's ancient car .
we found a snow field to walk around in .
my buddies found an area with a ice fall that we were able to slide down .
one friend was less successful in sliding down on his feet .
we drove back as the sun was going down , exhausted from our day .
one winter day , [male] could n't get the car to start because it was so cold .
so he decided to skip work instead and have a snow day with his friends .
they played in the snow ,
of course falling down multiple times .
this gorgeous winter day was the perfect one for [male] and his friends to take a snow day .
today we went to the beach for a nice trip .
there was a beach house which we were renting for the night .
there were a lot of fish today when i went out to go swimming .
the sun was setting and we were ready to go inside and eat then go to bed .
the sun was rising very slowly that morning . it would be far too cold to go swimming today .
went to the beach nd was delighted that it was n't crowded .
the pools were also empty making me feel like i had the whole place to myself .
the sky was beautiful in the late afternoon .
i saw schols of fish as the water was quite clear .
the sunset was remarkable .
the waves on the ocean came towards the shore .
employees at the vacation spot woke up every day and cleaned the pool .
no one knew how all of the little fish made it into the pool each day .
looking out over the ocean provided a feeling of relief to everyone who worked there .
wishing that the fish would stay in the ocean , and out of the pool , employees at the vacation spot watched the sun set on another confusing day .
we walked around the resort to see what was around .
we found a pool with a swim up bar .
in a pond near by there was fish that was swimming around .
then we watched out into the ocean .
we watched the sun set over the ocean .
our first beach vacation . upon arrival , we immediately headed to the beach .
after laying in the sand , we headed to the pool for some swimming and drinks .
the resort had a gorgeous view of the ocean .
it also had a cool goldfish pond , where you could feed the fish by hand .
our wonderful first day was capped off by this amazing sunset .
at the beach , my kids found an area to make a fort .
my little boy began building first .
he left to go recruit workers .
when he got back , my other son and daughter helped out .
when they got board , they left and went surfing .
kids are playing at the beach making a trench so the water can not get in .
the kids are making the sand tall but the waves are still hitting the sand .
the wave hits one end of the sand and moves some .
the kids run over to try and stop the water from taking the whole sand trench .
the kids are disappointed that the trench is almost completely gone .
my kids and i decided to go to the beach this weekend .
my son and two daughters started building a sand castle .
it turned into more of a sand fort , or perhaps a sand trench .
nonetheless , the kids had a blast building it .
the waves came in and started to erode the wall , much to my son 's disappointment .
the parents took the kids to the beach during summer vacation .
there , they build a nice sand ditch
in which they played inside .
their older sister kept trying to run through it ,
but it 's okay , they moved the ditch to try and keep her out .
[male] saw this indention in the beach , and knew it could be bigger .
he began to dig and dig , until he was surrounded by a mud wall around the entire hole .
however , he could not stop the oncoming ocean from trying to knock it down .
he tried to recruit some friends to help build it up against the sea .
alas , their help was not enough , and he finally gave in to the oceans continuous push to fill up his hole .
i am sipping a shot at a local bar .
i am checking my cell for any missed messages while away .
trying a local beer at a local restaurant .
great evening to be walking the beach .
and of course , standing on the plank while out fishing .
my friend and i spent a weekend on this cozy little island .
we rented a house by the water . it was a great place to take a long stroll after dinner .
next day we went sailing . the water looks cold but it was n't too bad .
[male] could n't resist acting a scene from titanic . always the clown !
back on shore , we headed to the local pub for dinner and drinks .
my friends and i decided to take a road trip through location .
we found a bunch of open fields and took our pictures in them .
nearby we found a lake , and across it a country church .
in town , my friend insisted on climbing on a boat and taking his picture like [female] from titanic .
at the end of the day , we found a local bar to sit in .
miked loved drinking beer before going to the ocean .
he was texting pictures of his friends of all the obscure microbrews he tried at the bar .
this ale was one of his favorites .
[female] ended up leaving [male] at the bar to drink while she went to go have fun .
[male] could n't find his way to the beach but he did recreate a scene from the titanic at the dock .
[male] liked to drink ,
and he liked to text ,
but most of all he liked to drink .
his sister , bev , however , like to be outside on the beach instead of inside drinking at the bar .
sometimes [male] would humor her and go outside to spend time with her , and those days were the best .
the night before the wedding we had a couple of beers
little [male] and i in the back seat of the car on the way to the wedding .
oh ... this is a great photo of [female] and [male] walking down the road

[female] had been a close friend since they were kids .
[male] and [female] had recently broke up but she still had n't told her why .
winona did n't want to pry into [female] 's personal affairs .
she knew [female] would tell her when she got ready .
winona wasnt very surprised when [female] told her she was and had been in love with a woman for quite some time .
the mother and her daughters took a picture by the beach .

i had a great time at the hike yesterday .
there were a lot of people there .
it was a lot of fun .
i was getting sunburned while i was there .
i decided to head back .
as we flew towards the island where we would spend the week , i could see the city spilling down the hillside towards the sea .
the hotel where we would spend our nights overlooked the harbor where i was able to watch the boats come in each afternoon .
on our second day , we hiked up the coast to a breathtaking overlook of the cliffs where they met the water .
on the hike home , we were followed a little ways by a curious resident of the island .
on our last night at the harbor , we ate dinner at a restaurant overlooking a quirky clock tower by the harbor . it looked like a bright red lighthouse on the dock .
the travel destination featured a large city nested within a beautiful natural location .
wildlife abounded in the natural areas .
some of the wildlife even made it onto the human world .
a hotel provided world class comfort .
a traveler was pleased by all aspects that the travel destination offered .
the island was so gorgeous .
there were always people walking around and exploring .
you could see beautiful heights if you were willing to climb .
and there were animals all over the place .
people always said once they got there they did n't want to leave .
i took this as we approached the island .
the town was almost deserted that morning .
a view from the road as we drove to our little get-away .
this little deer looked lost to me .
i took this from the museum window after our delicious lunch .
i took this picture from the plane on my trip to location .
the first town we visited did n't look anything like it expected .
however , when i saw the deep blue ocean water i knew that i had made the right choice .
i saw tons of wildlife on the trip , including several deer .
the weather was a little gloomier than i expected on most days .
the view at the camping site was beautiful .
i had a great time there .
there were many wildlife creatures there .
we spent some time exploring .
there was a small town nearby .
it was a beautiful day so i decided to go exploring .
i first went to visit a lighthouse .
i then watched some boats pass by .
i caught a couple of deer while they were eating .
after walking further , i came across an abandoned building and decided to investigate .
the travelers could see mountains in the distance as they reached their destination .
there was an old lighthouse that used to warn ships of danger .
they could see a ship in the distance .
deer were grazing in a nearby field .
they decided to explore the old underground bunker .
it was a nice evening next to the lake .
the deer were exploring the grass together .
they surveyed the area and looked for new things to eat .
nearby , in a town , it was quiet and there were no people around .
it was an eerie quiet and felt like it would end at any time .
our bed and breakfast had a wonderful view from our room .
we walked to the beach and found a beautiful lighthouse .
then we debated taking the ferry but it was too much for one day .
we relaxed instead and took photos of deer near the lighthouse .
we wondered what was behind this door under the lighthouse . we 'll never know .
a woman came with her binoculars to have a look at the ocean .
first she saw a duck swimming in the ocean .
she saw other birds in the surf looking for food .
suddenly one of them scampered on shore to eat a bit of fish .
then he saw the woman with the binoculars and scampered back into the sea .
[female] was out on an adventure to do some sight seeing .
she saw a nice duck in the water .
a beautiful cascading waterfall .
a sand piper running across the sandy beach .
finally she just kicked back and watched the clouds roll by .
we went for a walk on the beach , yesterday .
we were going bird watching .
the beach was a great place to do that , because the birds are all over .
they looked so funny picking away for food .
we definitely saw our share of birds .
i decided to practice my photography on nature .
i photographed a lonely duck at the lake .
then there was the waterfall and the stream in the woods .
i even caught a lone bird searching for food .
then there was the sky overhead that casted a darkness over the area .
[female] wanted to go out in nature to take photos .
she saw a duck and named him [male] .
she saw a small waterfall and named it [male] .
she saw a bird and named it [male] .
she saw a sunset and did n't name it because it 's not a living creature .
we were looking for the perfect place to have a wedding..
and , when we arrived at the pier , we felt we had found the location .
there was plenty of seating and a beautiful walk-up..
and , the decorative scene would make for a glorious wedding .
it was decided , we would get married here !
we walked down to the beach today .
what an incredible sculpture . it is so big and impressive .
we continued our walk down to the pier where we stopped to look at the seals .
sunset time - gorgeous views of the waters .
while walking back from the beach we saw this graffiti art . what a way to end the day .
i had a great time at the beach last weekend .
there were some monuments there .
i had a great time .
the weather was very good .
there were also some graffiti there .
when [male] arrived , all was quiet on the beach .
he walked around , enjoying the quiet and taking in the scenes .
he even sat for a while in the gazebo , enjoying the sound of waves crashing .
the construction work sat , abandoned for warmer days , and it made him feel isolated .
but the fun , creative graffiti put a smile upon his face .
during our vacation seeing the water was the best part .
we got to see the sunset on the water every night .
the docks were so much fun to walk around on .
seeing the blue sky behind the docks was breathtaking .
their was a little shop under one of the docks .
we got to stay in this little beach house this summer .
there was a nice covered area set up for us on the beach .
we often took naps here in the afternoon .
every morning we woke up to these kinds of sunrises .
on my last day , i knew i 'd miss this place .
we are at a beautiful tropical resort .
let 's explore the beach .
we found a tiny shack with thatched roof .
look at the beautiful horizon .
the water is so clear i can see the rocks below .
i went to the beach last weekend .
there was a huge stretch of sand .
i was the only person there .
the weather was very cloudy .
after a few hours the sun came back out .
the house next to the beach was the perfect location for us .
as newlyweds , we wanted to live in a place near the ocean .
this environment would be perfect for us and the baby .
the view was spectacular and there was not another person in sight .
my wife brought a swimsuit just to test how cold the water was .
[female] is on vacation at this beach side resort for two weeks .
she loves sitting out on the rocks watching the waves .
they have palm leaf cabanas for people to rest under .
a storm was offshore but the waters were still calm on the beach .
this is a picture of the room [female] stayed in .
my friends and i decided to go camping .
when we arrived at the camping site , we could n't get in due to a heard of sheep .
we had to turn back around , so we parked the rv near some water .
we decided to go boating .
we went on the beach afterwards to build sand castles .
it 's that time again to head out and find some fun adventures .
lots of snow capped mountains were explored .
a minor setback when the road was blocked by many sheep .
finally found some serenity to myself for awhile .
then it was time to hit the road again in search of fun and adventure .
i took my rv on a road trip last weekend .
there were a ton of animals on the road .
i had a great time there .
we also went on our boat .
i dug a hole and took a bath .
the rv drives down the road past all of the scenery .
the mountain behind is snowy and the field surrounding has trees .
a group of sheep block the path way for the rv .
it stops for a moment for the driver to stretch his legs .
they are back on the road again and on their current path .
on our trip through the country we took our large truck .
as we drove away the snowy mountains were breathtaking in the background .
a herd of sheep ran up to our truck as we drove by .
we parked our truck by the water to enjoy the view .
driving down the country road was extremely relaxing .
i went to the beach today .
it was in the middle of winter .
it was very cold there .
there were still animals in the ocean .
the snow was very deep in some places .
[male] was hiking among some rocks .
he felt like he was training to be in a boxing match or something .
he took in the view from high up .
then he snapped a selfie of himself .
then took another picture of the waves crashing up against the rocks .
we visited the mouth of a river the other day .
the river led right out into the ocean .
the water was foamy where the seawater met the river water .
there were cool animals there , like starfish .
we got a great view of the ocean from above .
we visited the rocks today ,
[male] enjoyed walking across ,
and almost falling below .
this little cutie kept hiding ,
and then got washed away with the water .
the view of the canyon was amazing .
i ca n't believe that we made it .
it was a long hike .
he was proud of our efforts .
we could feel the mist from the spray .
while the accommodations were small , it did n't matter because most of our time was spent out and about .

the area around the town was small and unimposing .
the cruise ship was magnificent .

i was staying in a hovel of a boarding house .
the cafeteria-style kitchen was n't that bad though .
the town was quiet and had no nightlife !

they snapped a picture of the bird flying over the ocean .
it was finally time to go home aft the sun had set .
when i look at this photo , it makes me believe , believe in a world that is much bigger than i can imagine .
the way the sky opened to allow the sun to shine through , is representative of hope .
as the sun set , we just stood there , forever inspired and changed .
the next day , the sea was gracious enough to be wavy so that we could surf .
that night , we waited to experience the sunset again .
the sky is blue with some fluffy white clouds .
the beach is pretty empty with only a few people going for a beachwalk .
the sun is setting right behind the ocean .
in the sky are birds that are looking for fish to eat .
the group of people on the beach are in the dark .

there 's the sunset mood , with lines of color .
there 's the during sunset mood , with a trail to the sun in the water .
i love all the moods . i could spend the rest of my life at the beach .
there was a bird on the beach hanging out with us while we waited for the sunset .
the bird was very patient about catching food .
while we were waiting , we talked about the last sunset was watched from that beach .

the lapping water was the perfect soundtrack for the evening .

the serene water is so amazing .
it is always amazing to see the wonders of the world call it a day .

the bird lives by the ocean .
sometimes the bird would go close to the water .
sometimes the bird would go in the water .
sometimes the bird would watch the sun set .
sometimes the bird would be in the dark on the ocean .

[male] trying to get a purchase on the rock face .
[male] hanging out right under the horizontal face .
[male] trying to get technical and scaling the horizontal face .
rock climbing is a great way to exercise .
[female] has been rock climbing since college .
her friend [male] just started rock climbing .
safety is the first precaution before trying to climb .
[female] always feels proud after a climb .
the cliff was high , but i knew we could do it .
we got our gear and started up .
some stayed at the bottom at first for extra safety .
the higher we got the further the ground was . it was exciting .
we climbed back down and gazed upon what we had just accomplished .
the mountain is tall and very rocky .
the man climbs up the mountain with all of his climbing gear on .
next his son comes up after him .
the father watches his sons progress from higher above .
the son is somewhat scared and does n't really want to be doing this .
that morning , i went with my partner and friends to the beach .
we took a group picture by the water .
then we went to do some bird watching and took pictures of these birds .
when we got home , i washed the car .
that night , i made sure our christmas lights were on .
the family went on vacation to a lovely isand .
the girls split of into their own group .
the men stayed at the hotel and had a great time .
they saw many sights on their trip , but this church was their favorite
eventually they had to return home to their modest house .
decided to go to the river today with some friends .
here we are taking a picture together at the pier .
the river had some ducks swimming arounds , i made sure to feed them before leaving .
got to drive home in this stylish cadillac , all my friends are jealous of it .
we lit up the house in christmas lights today and it looked amazing !
the young couple decided to visit their parents for a christmas holiday at the beach .
the father along with his sons posed by the waterfront instead of the traditional snowman .
usually covered in snow , the family was instead greeted by warm air and seagulls on their doorstep .
on christmas eve , there was no sign of snow .
on the night before christmas , the house was turned into a giant decoration to show christmas was finally here .
today we spent it with friends along the beach .
we walked along the piers that go out to the ocean .
we did have a fantastic view of the birds looking for fish in the water .
one of our friends was driving an old classic car .
we then took a trip to look at christmas lights on the houses .
i work at an observatory .
it is near the coast .
there is a lot of water around .
the front of the observatory is pretty large .
there are a lot of interesting plant life around .
this dome has been here for so long , seeing it is just amazing .
gazing down at the endless landscape , loving it .
water slowing lapping up onto the old and sharp rocks .
built so long ago , we are lucky to be able to see it still standing today .
far down , i wish i could be there with the trees .
we scouted this building a few miles away .
the scenery around the building was spectacular .
the water was brushing the shore .
as we got closer to the building , we realized its white color .
the shore was so beautiful next to the building .
my house is near an observatory .
one side of the observatory overlooks a forest .
the other side is near some water .
the main telescope is really large .
it typically faces the forest side .
an observatory up on the hill was the perfect spot to see all around .
you could look out on the hills to one side .
you could also get a beautiful view of the beach .
and you could just bask in the splendor of the building .
after looking at all the other places , though , the forest always seemed like the best view .
there was a school reunion at the old high school .
[male] and [male] former best friends decided to go on vacation together in order to catch up .
the drove for hours ,
to arrive at a beautiful beach to go surfing .
they played all day riding the waves and were able to talk well into the evening catching up on old times .
we took a trip to location location last weekend .
we saw the famous location smog .
people are very active here .
we had to visit one of the famous beaches .
location is so beautiful . we want to go back !
we went on a tour of location .
the smog is what we noticed first , it was nearly choking us .
we went and saw the iconic sights .
we ended the day at the beach .
we played and talked till the sun went down .
i said goodbye to my college campus for a spring break beach trip .
my roommate was coming with me .
we finally arrived , with some buddies in the taxi behind us .
ahhh ! the beach was so nice !
we stayed out for the sunset before heading back to the hotel .
the trees were standing near the building
that overlooked the city .
people were biking all around
and there was a beech too
where one person went to see .
night out on the town with my wife and brother !
found a theme park lets go see if we can play anything !
this is my favorite game at places like this .
gon na go on the carousel , glad no kids are hogging it !
the skyline of our city such an awesome night !
the three amigos eating dinner before we head over to location location .
love this view at night . ca n't wait to play games and ride the coaster .
of course the guys headed straight for skee-ball . neither of them are very good ... haha .
i rode the carosaul..it 's my favorite .
the view on the way home ... it never gets old .
some friends and i met for dinner one night when on vacation .
we were staying in a seaside town that catered to tourists .
we went outside and had a look around the carnival area .
a merry-go-round was in the center of the carnival , and we decided to ride it .
afterward , we took a picture of the bright lights of the town and the nearby steam ship .
we had a blast last night at the bar .
the scenery at night was so beautiful i had to take a pic .
my brother beat [male] in an arcade game .
the carousel was so beautiful .
i wish i could go out more . the night was so beautiful .
my husband and i started our evening at dinner with friends .
from the restaurant , we could see the lights of the amusement park where we would go next .
the guys enjoyed the arcade games , especially skeet ball .
the ladies , however , loved the merri-go-round .
later we took a night cruise on the bay in this ship docked near the amusement park .
went to visit the ocean and the water was so calm .
there were beautiful greenery and flowers everywhere .
there were more orange flowers to be seen .
along tne way i saw this beautiful bridge .
by the end of the day the waves began to pick up and crash into the rocks .
today we decided to take a trip to that cove .
we took a few pictures on the way , it was a neat place .
i 've never been here before , but my brother insists that it is a great place to see
the cove itself was small however , it did n't give much room .
we decided to leave and possibly try again , another day .
we crossed a bridge to arrive at our destination .
the water in the secluded area was a dark blue .
the sea foam looked so nice against the coast .
the waves were so powerful .
it looked to dangerous to swim though .
i took a long drive up the coast and took pictures of everything i saw , like the ocean .
further in , a raging stream met the ocean with a strong current .
the river formed a tidal estuary that had carved out a little valley from the rock .
nearby , a large bridge went over a rocky gorge .
the cliffs were daunting where they met the sea .
the weather trackers wanted to go out to the island to observe the oncoming storm . to do so , they had to drive out the coast along this bridge .
the team took a vantage point overlooking the cove in order to view the storm .
one member tracked the changes in sea level as the storm surge came in .
the waves became more and more powerful , crashing high into the rocks .
the cove became very turbulent as the storm approached .
meet [male] , he is a professional dancer .
this is [female] , [male] 's friend . [female] has a crush on [male] .
the live together on the seaside .
once in a while they go fishing together .
sometimes they just hang out on the beach .
a day at the beach . i like how the stairs go right into the water .
they just disappear under the water ... so weird .
it would be nice to live in one of these houses , except during hurricane season .
the birds were circling something in the water .
almost like having our own private beach today . i could handle that .
look at me enjoying my day at the beach . taking a picture of my girl .
check my girl out she is all smiles and relaxed .
we love being on vacation . we do not want to leave .
love our view of the beach . it is absolutely breath taking .
nothing but pure relaxation time on the beach . ca n't wait for tomorrow to get back out there .
[male] had waited for months , and at last he was on vacation at the beach .
his wife was very happy that she could go with him .
they stayed in a quaint cabin just feet away from the ocean .
they were able to take walks along the cement pier every day .
every evening they went to the empty beach to watch the sunset .
this is a picture of a man .
this is a picture of a woman .
this is a picture of a boardwalk .
this is a picture of a beach .
this is a picture of the shore .
i was hungry .
so i went to the beach .
there we lots of dunes .
i bought some tickets .
and i won this hot blonde !
i decided to play the lottery .
i got lucky and won not one but two tickets .
with the money , i bought a bunch of tasty treats .
we watched some expensive plays .
i spent the rest of the money hiring my own private fire fighter squad .
day trip to location location .
husband bought tickets to a broadway show .
we stopped for ice cream first .
radio city music hall , the show was terrific .
we stopped to get pictures with the firemen near ground zero .
i went to go buy some tickets for the show tonight .
they were very expensive .
we went to grab some food before the show .
there were a lot of people there .
i took some pictures with the local fire department while i was there .
the woman decided to have something sweet to eat .
afterwards , she wanted to go to the beach , but had trouble finding somewhere to park .
finally , she and a friend found a parking spot and made it to the beach .
they were having a good day , so they decided to try their luck on the lottery .
they took a few photos as well .
i told [male] he was crazy . no one had special powers .
he laughed and told me he 'd do something incredible .
i watched in horror as the sun went backwards in the sky .
it started sinking below the horizon .
right as it was about to disappear , [male] stopped . i would never distrust [male] ever again .
the sun is setting over the ocean . [male] be dark soon .
a better picture of the sun . love the purple sky around it .
and almost gone .
just a selfie of myself before the sun totally goes away for the day .
awesome sky tonight . time for a beer .
the sunset is an interesting color .
the water goes on forever .
the sun is almost totally set .
in the morning its , always nice to chill outside for w while .
the sky is mixed with all kinds of colors .
hi guys this is an amazing vacation .
look at me smiling and enjoying my day .
take a look at this beautiful sunset . you just ca n't beat this look .
the sun going down is amazing . i can not believe this view .
look at the seagulls enjoying the sun going down with me .
[male] visited his friends who lived in a coastal community .
he had never seen the ocean in person before , so they took him on a trip to the beach .
he enjoyed the beach so much that he stayed until sunset .
he watched the sun drop out of view while listening to the ocean waves .
as the sun went below the horizon , he noticed the purple clouds contrasting with the blue waves .
here is my little man who is the love of my life and right here it looks like he just ca n't wait to to get his hands in the mud because he just loves to get muddy looking for little animals .
here is my other little one and i suppose she is just as excited even though she is a wonderful little girl .
here we are making our way to another part of the flat that is sure to hold some special finds in all that mud .
this picture shows both my little ones and little [male] looks like he is trying to either show his sister one of his finds or to help her with some instructions .
it has been a wonderful day and the tide has come back in so we will watch the boats for a while and then go home and come back again another day .
[female] time can be a lot of fun . running care free with shorts on .
there is no better way to spend the day then collecting shells on the shore .
[female] fun is great when you get to explore the sand .
playing in the sand can be fun but only when with my sister .
brother and sister fun enjoying and exploring the beach .
my baby sister and i were very excited to explore the coastal island .
it was low tide and she had fun playing in the mud , but there was more to see .
we walked in the tide pool to try and find seashells .
my baby sister was a little scared when i showed her a sea critter i found .
after exploring the island , we took a boat back home .
the kids ran down the muddy path ,
and then they jumped in the mud .
they loved walking through the mud even though it was dirty .
they even sat down and rolled around in it a few times ,
so they headed off the to lake where they could jump in and clean themselves off .
the trails at the park are always fun to walk .
sister liked splashing her feet in the water .
many of us enjoyed a walk near the water .
we had fun looking for shells and rocks .
the opportunities for a good view were endless .
today we went on a hike to the bench .
the view from the overlook was great !
[male] was so excited to play in the ocean for the first time .
although he got himself all wet and dirty .
by the end of the day he was exhausted and fell asleep on the way home .
it was a beautiful day to go to the beach .
dad took little [male] out to do some digging in the wet sand .
[male] did some of the digging with his head .
the water felt nice , but the sand was pretty gross .
after the excursion and digging , [male] slept all the way home .
the family walked down the trail
until they finally saw the water !
mom and son walked through the sand ,
well actually , son more like played in the sand ,
until he was too tired to go on so they had to go home .
we took the family out on a hike .
we got down to the beach through a trail .
[male] picked up shells and played .
he loved the water , but unfortunately it was time to go .
he passed out on the car ride home .
we went on vacation and came to the forest .
after the forest we headed to the beach .
we walked down to the water .
he had so much fun playing in the ocean .
at the end of the day he was so tired .
although [male] was their boss , he was still on of them .
[male] had become just one of the guys .
they called themselves the organization organization 's plus one .
they vacationed together .
[male] was a great boss but he was a better friend and they were glad he was one of them .
we spent some time in location last month .
the first thing we checked out was the beach .
of course , we had to do some shopping while we were there too .
one of the coolest sights we saw was this sports car .
location is beautiful . i ca n't wait to return !
[male] was tired of being at the office .
he got his friends to come with him to party .
everyone was having fun together .
[male] liked to be a clown .
[male] 's friend [male] was glad he decided to hang out today .

with the weekend over it 's time to head back to the hotel and get ready to go home .
a family went on a trip .
they climbed up the hill ,
to see some beautiful old trees .
they later went fishing .
but the weirdest part of the trip was the sculptor of a lady laying on the grass . they were so shocked that they did n't realize they did n't take pictures of themselves until after the day was done .
the pathway to the camp on the lake we had .
a barge floating on the lake on the way to camp .
our sign directing us to camp .

here is the sign at the bottom of location location trail .
looking out towards one of the lakes in the area. ,
this sculpture was on the lawn of the institution. ,
this weekend we went hiking to location location .
the trail was long and steep .
we saw many large trees along the way .
the colors were amazing .
at the top we took a break at the lodge .
felt like a hike today . where better than to location location ?
the trails here are really pleasant .
when you get in deep , the trees get truly lush and massive .
the pond can really look great too . just have to find the right sunlight and right reflection .
just had to snap a photo of this odd sculpture on the drive back home !
she had studied art for years .
she was fond of bronze sculptures .
the thinker , was by far her favorite .
he inspired her to think of far away destinations .
she had a vivid imagination and envisioned many exotic places .
we visited the botanical garden today .
there were tons of different flowers on display .
we chose this one as the most beautiful flower .
and this was the most unusual thing we saw .
the grounds are so pretty , i am sure we will return soon .
i tended the garden today .
there were a lot of flowers that needed to be plants .
some of them were very beautiful .

the girls splashing around in the surf and having fun .
our chairs and umbrella in black and white . lonely , but cool shot .
the family takes a day trip to location location . it 's going to be a lot of fun .
we 're early but wow , there 's a lot of people on the beach already . that 's too crowded , we decided to take a walk down the beach to find somewhere a little less packed with people .
the stroll down the beach is lovely and we 've found somewhere much less busy to set up for the day . time to catch some rays and work on that tan !
it 's hungry work laying out in the sun all day . we decide to visit a local food vendor . it 's busy here too , look at the line !
finally , we get served and now we 're really hungry . everybody say cheese ! okay , let eat !
mom and all 5 daughters on a road trip to the beach .
we stopped at the over look to get the great picture opportunity .
the beach was pretty crowded since it was a warm summer day .
the girls had a great time frolicking in the water .
we made a little beach area to get away from the crowded beach so we could relwax and watch the waves .
is was time for our family beach trip .
we were all so excited , we could hardly wait to swim .
we all ran down the stairs to dig out feet in the sand .
we played in the waves till we had no more energy .
then sat and relaxed till the sun went down .
a house on the beach is a great place to get together .
a hot tub helps the family relax .
then they play some music .
some people play video games .
while in the kitchen , dinner is prepared .
i came up from the beach to relax in the shade away from the bugs .
but , a dragonfly landed on my chair .
all my friends laughed because i could not get away from bugs to relax .
even though i wanted to relax without bugs , i was fascinated by the shape of his wings and body .
after he flew away , i tried again to relax in the hot tub and told my story about trying to relax without bugs .
my friends and i rented a seaside house for a week .
the best part of the house was a hot tub out back that three of my friends were always in .
we had a picnic table on the front porch that we used as a kind of central feature .
other friends sat inside watching tv .
in the kitchen , we took turns being in charge of the various meals .
this weekend we took a family trip to the beach .
later we chilled in the hot tub and had some brews .
[male] and susi decided to bring out their instruments and play a tune for us .
even on vacation my brother decides to watch tv .
later the family cooked some delicious dinner .
my sister and i rented a cabin right on the beach last summer .
there was a hot tub right on the deck ! talk about relaxing .
we had time to pursue our hobbies , like playing the recorder .
and of course , the kids watched a lot of tv , even though we were right on the beach .
my sister and i did a lot of cooking and talking . it was a great vacation .
some buddies of mine decided to celebrate my birthday here by the lake .
we all decided that we would go swimming .
so we took off our clothes , and conquer this lake .
too bad this lake was very cold . i should have known , since there was no sun to even heat up this lake .
we laughed it up , and decided to just spend my birthday , dry .
after a long day of work , we went to the beach .
we brought my dog because she was bored at home .
my coworkers stripped in excitement .
then we played in the sea for a bit to cool off steam .
when we got dressed up again , we took a group picture .
after parking his car , a man walks to the beach to join his friends .
he catches up to them as they are walking alongside the water .
they finally find the perfect spot to go swimming and quickly strip down to their swimming trunks .
they have a blast goofing off in the water together .
they are cold when they get out , so they quickly put the rest of their clothes back on .
have you ever heard of the polar bear plunge ? let me tell you about it !
you might see some guys at the beach in the middle of winter , when it 's certainly not beach weather .
then , they start taking off their clothes and stripping to bathing suits !
you wo n't believe it when they actually run into the frigid water .
afterward , they pose for a picture . they are crazy guys , but they have a lot of fun .
the only sane one here . going to watch these fools jump in the lake . its only 32 degrees this morning .
looking for a great spot to make their entry .
crazy people . not sure what they think this will prove .
laughing so hard right now . glad its them and not me .
after shot . did i mention what fools they are ?
we went on a big boat trip today .
the weather was great and you could see miles away .
the views were amazing and the water was blue .
other people had the same idea and were taking a boat trip .
we stayed on the water to see the sundown , it looked like from a magazine !
the boys decided to take a camping trip .
to get to the camp site they had to take a boat .
[male] brought a nice hammock to sleep in on the trip .
on the last day of the trip the boys decided to go into town .
they were tired of eating camp food so they found a nice cafe to eat dinner at .
in the morning , we walked on the shore towards the sea
to enter into a green boat .
we rode on it and saw clear waters with small islands .
other boats were present as well but not overwhelming .
as the day ended , we watched the sun set .
chilling by the mountains , the rocks are humongous .
we are on the boat just taking in the scenery .
a hammock in the middle of the mountains is n't weird at all , perfectly normal , lol .
i love hanging out and spending time with my friends .
time to have a few brews and have a good time .
in college i took a trip to location with two of my best friends .
we spent a lot of time on the water enjoying the warm weather .
as usual , i spent as much time as possible lounging , and this hammock was so comfortable .
every restaurant in location was absolutely fantastic .
i would eat the food in any kind of conditions , but outside by the water is the best .
the van we took on the trip .
the area we swam in .
the boats we saw while fishing .
the boat we saw while sitting on the beach .
the area we went snorkling in .
today the gang and i decided to go on a groovy adventure !
we went to the coast and found some really neat places .
old man jenkins even took us out on his boat . jinkies it was neat !
he took us to a neat spot and we were really excited !
this spot was really neat , but gang we did n't solve any mysteries ! back in the van !
we are on vacation , and having a great time traveling around .
today we are haded to this island .
we will be traveling by boat .
this boat goes way faster than we expected , it was fun !
what a beautiful place this turned out to be .
i drove to the sea shore and took pictures of everything i saw , including this van inspired by the far side .
there was a small bay that was very calm and was set aside for swimming .
i saw some local fishing boats heading out to ply their craft .
the ocean formed clear pools near the edge , and i could look down to see the wildlife .
further in , the shoreline was filled with wonderful plants .
every summer , we load up the crazy [male] and head to the ocean .
our favorite place is an isolated cove called manning 's hideout .
we get the boats going , and do a lot of island hopping .
the views , with the many brilliant shades of blue , would take your breathe away .
the cove is a truly magical place . we know how lucky we are to be able to go there .
i went to the beach last week .
there were a lot of people there building sand castles .
i had a great time there .
there were a lot of buckets left behind .
after a few hours we left to head back home .
a family traveled to a beach to enjoy time together .
the father played with the kids to entertain them .
although at times it looked as if he was entertaining himself more .
running in the water reminded the father of when he was a child running on a beach .
although the mother did not get sandy or wet , she enjoyed the outing as well .
it was a beautiful day for a family vacation
dad played with the kids in the water
and built many castles made out of sand
they loved the water so much
and mom was so happy to be there
me and the family went to the beach for a day of fun .
here i am making a sand castle . i did have helpers but they left me .
see them , way over there . they think they can just run off and play while i clean the mess .
here 's the mess , great . it 's gon na get taken in the sea .
they were just kidding , they came back to help me .
another day at the beach .
sand castles would be made .
people would wade .
buckets would be left behind .
occasionally a kid would get lost .
on my vacation , i came across a giant pineapple .
i decided to go inside , and it was a store that sold only pineapple products !
after i exited the pineapple , i went to the farmers market .
i bought some food for lunch !
i decided to spend the rest of my afternoon at the beach .
visiting a pineapple shaped house .
visiting the farmers market right after .
about to eat lunch at that restaurant .
our fish and chips meal .
went swimming after lunch .
i went to grab some food last week .
they had a huge menu .
there were a lot of people getting lunch .
i was very full afterward .
when i finished i went to the beach .
i went to a fascinating organization organization last week inside of a giant pineapple .
it was not the least bit surprising that they were selling many pineapple and other tropical fruit products .
the farmers market also featured an excellent little restaurant .
i ordered a seafood dish because i really wanted some shrimp .
after we ordered our food we took it outside and ate on the beach .
when a new restaurant opened in town i was surprised that it was fashioned after a pineapple .
once i was inside i found out the reason behind it was that it was a location restaurant .
outside many people began approaching , all eager to try out the new food .
not only did it taste great , but it looked great to .
after all that food though i need to burn off some calories so i hit the beach .
[female] was working as a lifeguard for the summer , she was really taking it very seriously .
she noticed an adorable pair of children on the beach , they made her smile .
she then noticed that the little girl was missing .
she scanned the shore but could n't find her .
she called back up and they took the boat out and rescued her .
our week at the beach was fantastic .
the kids loved playing in the beach .
my wife loved laying out in the sun .
i finally caught up with my reading .
we 'll miss those days at the pool and beach !
it was a beautiful day at the beach
the kids were playing in the sand
the boys played alone
and the waves came crashing in
the boat was going up a wave
the things you see on the beach . here is the lifeguard doing his job .
here are two kids trying to build a sand castle .
this kid is sitting in soft sand , you wo n't get a sand castle with that sand kid .
see the kite off in the distance . i took this picture for my wall .
a speedboat drives by to make better waves .
it 's 4th of july at a location beach and the lifeguards are busy keeping watch .
there are a lot of children playing in the sand .
they like building sand castles and watching the waves take them down .
this red flag is warning of a rip tide in the water .
a boat keeps eye further out for possible sharks in the area .
we went and visited a luxury beach resort for our annual vacation .
we decided to go and see the beautiful beach .
amazingly there were some se life that were on the beach . we saw a turtle .
we also saw a ray that had come up on the shore . we were so happy .
we felt like the giants that our shadows looked like . great trip .
i love to travel .
this place is amazing .

and do .
i must come back .
i went to the beach last weekend .
it was very cloudy there .
i found a bunch of seashells .
i took some of the with me .
i took a lot of pictures last weekend .
[male] and [male] were thrilled to have the private beach to themselves .
they wiled away the hours in silence , enjoying the serene views .
the plucked a few shells for their bowl at home .
[male] always loved the odd-colored/ textured shells .
they wrapped up their sojourn with shadow selfies .
i went down to the beach the other day .
it was so pretty and i had a nice time relaxing .
i found some really cool fossil type things down there .
this was a dead animal , but it was still cool to find .
the sun was at the perfect angle to take this awesome shadow photo .
after lunch i decided to go out for a ride .
i got on my bike .
it was a lot of fun .
i rented the jacket .
i gave it back afterward .
my friends and i went to the beach , but it was empty .
we went to the cafe instead to get some lunch .
we went back to the beach and rode our bikes .
we decided to stay until sunset .
once the sun set , we had a bonfire on the beach .
we picked a beautiful spot to do some motorcycle riding .
nothing better to start out our day than with a good breakfast .
we parked the bikes and set out on foot first to scout the area .
the ocean and the beach were a beautiful sight to see .
that night we made a campfire to keep warm .
we were hoping to go surfing today , but the ocean is not cooperating .
so we decided to go to a local cafe that we have been hearing about .
on our way back home , we decided to take a pit stop so that we could a picture of this view .
it seems that high tide is occuring , because the tide is almost to where we are standing .
my husband decided to build a small fire so that we could stay warm .
she made a quick burger for their lunch .
they ate in their small shop .
they sold motorbikes .
and scuba gear could be rented from them .
if they did n't have what you wanted , someone in the tiny village would .
i love to take walks along the beach and this morning a walk sounded like a great idea .
the beach was empty when i arrived .
the waves sounded so peaceful as they rolled in .
the sand became rougher as i headed down the beach .
i walked about half an hour until i decided it was to head back home . it was a peaceful way to start my day .
[female] took a walk on the beach and decided to contemplate her life .
she tried to focus on other things like the beauty of the beach .
she felt so lonely , and she was .
the beach was also lonely and it seemed to be ok .
she decided to take more time for herself and to take time for herself .
my friend and i spent a quiet day down by the beach .
we sat in our lawn chairs and talked .
it was nice to just look out into the water and relax .
it was soothing to hear the tide come in and go out .
it was a restful day with my friend .
came to the beach to be alone with my thoughts .
picked a spot to sit and enjoy the waves .
no waves i 'll just enjoy the sand .
hm , found the waves and now i 'm enjoying myself .
look at the small rocks on the beach . i tried to get as low as i could .
i went to the beach last week and was surprised to see no other people .
i wandered the beach for others in quiet and isolation .
i did n't even see a single person swimming in the ocean .
it 's a shame because the waves were pretty good .
people may have been steering clear of this beach because the sand is quite rocky .
time to get out on the water and have some fun .
alright he got up and is cruising out there on the water .
the wind has picked up and he 's really sailing now .
he winged around the pole and is full on going .
alright now it 's even more interesting as others have joined in on the fun .
[male] was new to para sailing .
at first he looked like he had the hang of it .
but then he toppled over again and again .
there he goes . he almost has it .
and [male] got it . he 's a pro !
it was kind of a cold day at the beach , but we were ready to go windsurfing !
i was already out in the water , and [male] took some time getting his gear ready , but he eventually made it into the water .
he was n't really used to windsurfing , but he eventually go t the hang of it , and he made it out pretty far .
on his way back , he commented that this was the most fun he 's had in quite a while .
he thought he was an expert by now , so we raced out to the boundary , and he lost big time !
this is a picture of the beach .
a man is surfing on the beach .
one person is in the water .
the sky is very clear .
two people are windsurfing on the beach .
the surfer carried his board to the water .
he got it going and held on tightly .
he had to be careful to avoid objects in the water .
he managed to avoid the objects and ride the board down the water .
he met up with a friend and they rode together .
went to an old carnival festival . we did have fun .
yah , we are headed to wonder wheel .
this was very high but i was n't scared .
wonder wheel i want off .
ok , next to location , should be more tame .
the girls made an obscene gesture for their picture .
there was a huge number of people at the fair today .
the village voice performed at the music festival .
the wonder thrills wheel was the most popular ride at the fair .
the fair is n't complete without a ride on the ferries wheel .
friends went to the music festival together .
there was a large crowd that was attending .
they all stood by the stage to watch the musicians perform .
after the concert , they waited in line to get on the ferris wheel .
they decided the line was too long , so they left .
spending the day at the music festival .
the infamous ride ! !
look at the size of that ferris wheel !
going up ! ! !
our last ride for the night
every year the village voice hosts a music festival in location location .
sometimes i go for the music , but often i just go for the amusement park rides .
the ferris wheel is always one of the best rides .
this particular organization organization was old , and rickety , so i was pretty scared .
we ended our day riding a few rides in location .
the group came together for groups at night
during the day , the group went swimming all together
at night , the group went out to their favorite restaurant
the ocean was beautiful and they enjoyed swimming in it immensely .
they enjoyed a gorgeous sunset at the end of their trip .
bowling night was looked forward to all week .
the girls had a league of their own .
the guys tried hard to beat them .
one of them would try to distract them by flirting .
every time he got a strike all the guys chanted , `` we 're number 1 . ''
i went to the beach for a party .
there were a lot of my friends there .
we also had a barbecue while we were there .
the view was amazing .
i loved the sunset .
this is a picture of a bowling alley .
a woman is about to bowl .
a man is about to bowl .
this is a picture of a man .
this is a picture of a man having fun .
me and my friends went to the bowling alley .
we mostly just clown around but its still fun .
[male] never takes it serious .
it will stay his turn sometimes forever because he clowns around .
we just let him get it out of his system .
we decided to take to boat out around the island for the day .
we went to our favorite cove for a little swim .
the local wildlife put on a show for us while we were there .
they got a little curious about our presences and swam up to meet us .
as the day came to end we watched the sunset near the old lighthouse .
the weather was beautiful for sailing .
even the seals lay on the sand because the weather was perfect .
we spotted a local feeding a seal . luckily there were not a lot of them there .
the breath taking view can only be taken from a high spot .
luckily , i took the beautiful view from atop of this light house .
going to be a great day by the water .
we are traveling to this shore .
check out the animals of the sea .
they are so friendly , they come right up to us .
we had such a great day , sad to see it end .
today was the perfect day to go sailing .
along the way i saw these amazing seals .
and i even had the chance to try feeding one .
after feeding the seals i docked the boat for a bit and went for a walk on the beach .
to finish off my day trip i caught a view of the sunset from the lighthouse .
a coworker invited my family on his sailboat .
we took a trip to an island famous for it 's seal population .
my husband made a new friend who was looking for a free meal .
the view was breathtaking and the weather perfect .
i love lighthouses so we could n't leave until i saw one .
[female] waited for years to go on the trip of her dreams .
on the way there she looked out the windows .
she saw lakes encased in snow ,
and snow capped mountains .
but the best part of the flight was seeing a real lava flow from the mountain in the safety of the aircraft .
they viewed mountains from above .
they also viewed the peaks from far away mixed in with clouds .
the water offered beautiful , shimmery scenery from above .
the land looked almost ominous from above .
when the sunset , they enjoyed their time in the sky the very best .
the view from the fighter jet was scary .
the jet was going super fast .
the pilot could see the ocean for hundreds of miles from his cockpit .
he could see small towns from his jet .
going up above the clouds the view eventually disappeared .
this is a picture of snowy mountains .
this is a picture of an airplane .
this is a picture of an ocean .
this is a picture of mountains .
this is a picture in the sky .
while ridding in the airplane she decided to look out the windows .
the window almost looked like it had a crack in it and she wondered what would happen if it cracked all the way .
she looked over at the clouds that made their own city .
she wondered why everything looked like tiny ants while in the sky .
she thought the sun hitting the lake made it look like a glowing snake .
we were so excited when we finally arrived at the resort .
the cottage we were assigned was so huge !
the living area had enormous windows with fantastic views .
the livingroom had a large fireplace with a gas fire which we lit up right away .
we could walk right down from the back deck to the dock and ended up spending a lot of our days just swimming there .
a couple and their parents went to a cottage to spend the holidays .
near the cottage there were destination , one which included a carousel .
the couple 's parents were young and active .
at the cottage , there was a small pine tree indoors .
the young woman enjoyed one of the gifts she received .
my friends and i decided to rent an a-frame house for my friend [female] 's birthday .
first , we went to visit the carousel in the town .
next , we walked over to the beach to take pictures and observe the water .
two of my friends decided to cuddle and pose for a picture next to the fireplace .
[female] got a board game for a present , and we all decided to play the game that night .
everyone chipped in and rented a house for the weekend for the family reunion .
the quirky town that the house was at had a fair going on that week .
[male] and [female] had n't seen each other since the last family reunion . it was hard to find time to meet up when you live on opposite coasts .
[male] and [female] were happy about setting up the family reunion every year .
gifts were exchanged like usual . this family really loved each there even separated by long physical distances .
wanting a return to the memory of her childhood , [female] convinced her fiance to travel with her to location .
they stayed in the same cabin she had visited with her family when she was just a child .
the view spawned many memories of the times they had spent at the resort .
she was very thankful that she could show him the place that had meant so much to her .
they had a great time while there , spending their days on the lake and nights in the cabin .
the beautiful flower we found on the beach .
the beautiful clouds in the sky from the beach .
the canal we took to go fishing .
the amazing rock with trees growing .
a dead fish on the shore .
today i was on the beach when suddenly something caught my eye .
the beach was empty at the time , but i looked beyond the beach
i saw a neat island . what was it doing there ?
i decided to swim there and climb to the top . there was this neat flower.. then i got sleepy .
where am i ? what happened ? this is definitely not the island i was just on .
my friend and i took a trip to see the beach near our homes .
we saw a wide-open beach with almost no people on it .
just offshore was a small island that somehow had not eroded away .
a nearby field was filled with grass and small flowers .
a fallen tree nearby was evidence of strong storms in the area .
the man was awed by the beauty of the beach .
the beach stretched for miles and miles .
the man wondered if he could explore the island that sat in the middle of the ocean .
instead , he decided to take a walk in the nearby fields and see the wildflowers .
in addition to the flowers , there were other interesting sights , such as a tree that toppled over from a storm .
nature adventure this morning with the new camera .
pretty shot . think i nailed the composition .
these ducks kept checking me out . to funny .
just wow . need i really say more . i could photograph this all day .
poor fish . at least its an interesting subject .
this is a very unusual place . it looks normal enough from the outside .
it 's a museum of makeup and before you think i 'm strange , i 'm a makeup artist .
i designed the makeup for these two . i 'm proud of the results .
being a tourist as well as an artist , i had to have a photo with these characters .
i 'm glad my girlfriend got into the act . we had a great time .
this is [male] . he is into creepy sci-fi things .
his house is a museum for weird sci-fi creatures .
he uses this to scare off kids on halloween .
he made this robot and taught it to talk .
this is a super size replica of the coffee drinking worms from men in black .
there 's a building that looks like a castle in our town that we 've always wanted to visit .
it turned out that it was filled with alien replicas . my brother loved that .
there were two statues that were so lifelike !
my brother got a kick out of the green , blobby ones .
i like the one that looked like a princess .
we visited the doctor who museum today !
there were props from the movie , like this head of boe .
there was also models of characters .
the exhibits were very real looking !
some of the characters we could n't recall though .
the outside looked like a far east castle .
inside were some amazing creations that looked like real life aliens .
there was a king and queen from another world .
i posed with their subjects .
then later we became acquainted with the princess .
the water was way up today . almost taking over .
another area that was flooded .
the part of the water that we finally could get the boat into to go sailing .
saw a few natives along the way ... good thing they are friendly ... haha .
look at the different colors of the ocean . almost looks like a painting .
we decided to take a boat tour of the coast .
first we passed a saltwater marsh .
there were many types of plants growing there .
lots of birds enjoyed the marsh as well !
it was a beautiful day .
i love going to the local lake and watching the boats fly by .
the marshes have secrets that are better left unexplored .
as we rode by in our boat i ca n't help but admire all the greenery .
we docked here and did a little fishing but nothing was biting .
we are now on our way back to the slip to park the boat for the night . what a great time i had on the water .
this is a picture of a clearing .
this is an empty outdoors scene .
this is a picture of a pond .
this is a picture of a lake .
this is a picture of an ocean .
the boaters were in a race to see who could catch the most in the allotted time .
one decided that this would be an ideal spot to catch the biggest ones .
they got distracted by the foliage that was around them .
the driver miss judged the depth of the water and they ended up getting stuck here .
the smart boaters decided to head over that way and have a few drinks and enjoy the quiet while the rest fought to win .
many have said that the trees in the forests around the location location are embodied by spirits with distinct personalities .
it does n't take long in the forest to guess why . trees , covered in moss , twist and turn creating protrusions that look almost like limbs .
in some of the older specimens , decaying wood and dirt spills out of hollow cavities giving the impression of a creature bleeding .
still other trees are poised with limbs outstretched as if begging for the heavens to provide an answer .
it is rare in this dense forest to see trees that look like nothing more than they are .
the american shrubby tree grows only a few places .
we hiked to the preserve near the ocean that they can be found .
they grow much closer to salt water than most trees .
they are noted for the holes in their trunks that seem to be vomited out red bark .
we stayed until sunset , marveling at nature .
the view from up here is breathtaking .
the trees look like they may come alive .
the trees are alive with a powerful energy .
the water is such a clear blue , you can see straight to the bottom .
everything is green and healthy to look at .
it was a beautiful day hiking in the mountains . we saw this tree sticking out a hilltop .
the view from the top was incredible and we could see the whole lake .
the day was getting darker as we descended and saw the waves pick up on the lake .
we saw this huge old tree with some of the trunk missing .
as the day ended , we watched the sun set over the lake from our camp .
this is a picture of a tree .
this is a picture of the ocean .
this is a picture on a cloudy day .
this is a picture of the woods .
this is a picture of the sunsetting .
during our vacation , my brother decided that he wasted to try parachuting .
her he is coming up on the beach .
as he got close po landing , as sudden wind gust knocked him a little off course .
everything worked out well though . he landed safely and said it was fun .
as we left the parachute behind , he asked me to try it , but i told him no way !
[male] wanted to do as many extreme sports as he could this weekend .
he had never been on a para-sail before .
being up in the air gave him a sense of adrenaline .
afterwards he rode a dirtbike around the track .
going on jumps gave [male] the type of satisfaction that he could only get by pushing his limits .
my sister was brave enough to try base jumping .
she picked out parachute , the pink one suited her .
she floated in the sky like a bird .
she landed safely on the beach .
as we left , she was screaming that she was ready to do it again !
this is a picture of a kite .
this is a picture of a parachute .
this is a picture of a man in the air .
this is a picture of a beach .
this is a picture of a nice day .
decided to go gliding today !
roamed around for a while , just checking out the sights .
look at me fly !
had a pretty calm landing . right next to the beach too .
off to pack up and get ready for the next jump .
we sailed our boast into the historic port .
the remains of an old fort could be scene on the hill .
we were able to go ashore and tour the fort .
afterwards we went shopping for local goods .
the night we returned to our boat for a good nights sleep .
the food in this village is so good . i 'll probably gain weight .
amazing how the houses are built right on the cliff . love this village .
an old fort . we did n't get to tour it today , but hopefully tomorrow .
another view of the fort . heard it 's haunted..ca n't wait to go inside .
the fishing boats glowing in the light of the sunset . so beautiful .
we went to the marina on a nice , clear day .
we stopped by some neat historic sites .
at another site , we saw some people sailing their boat .
after checking out the historic sites near the water , we wen to an awesome candy store .
and then at night , we went back to the pier to see all the boats and lights for a wonderful end to our day .
this is a picture of a clearing .
this is a picture of an ocean .
this shows an old castle .
this is a picture of a shop .
this is a picture of a harbor .
i went on a vacation and bought sum yummy delicacies to take home as a souvenir .
these houses were perched on the water and up the hill . i can just imagine what sort of view they wake up to every day !
i did not get around to going on a sailboat but i did take a picture of one .
the view from this hill was simply exquisite .
the view did not suffer at night . it was marvelous as well .
[female] was happy to go on her first vacation in two years .
she had a fantastic hotel .
and met up with family and friends there to have dinner .
she later enjoyed herself on the beach with family and relaxed .
later she went diving and saw the fish she always wanted .
after our trip to the beach we decided to go see the aquarium .
there was all kinds of sea life on display .
this eel popped his head out for a picture .
they even had jellyfish there .
this lion fish is poisonous !
here i am on my trip to a local beach and aquarium .
i love going to the aquarium and seeing all of the different animals . here is a sea crab .
there are all kinds of fish that live in the reefs . here is a spotted fish .
there are many different kinds of different jelly fish in the sea . this one i though was particularly cool .
here is the beautiful but deadly lion fish . i 've always love these guys .
this is a picture of a boat .
this is a picture of a hotel .
this is a picture of a family .
this is a picture of a beach .
this is a picture of water .
[female] poses here in front of her uncle 's boat .
we spent the afternoon on the beach with all the locals .
dad and [male] are waiting expectantly for their sea food dinner .
here is a view of the 5 star hotel we stayed at .
i took this picture at the aquarium on the waterfront .
it was very rainy while we were driving down to the beach .
the weather got much better when we arrived .
the ocean was beautiful .
some of my friends came with me to the beach .
i spent most of my time sleeping .
[female] was excited to be taking a roadtrip with her family .
as they headed down to a popular beach everyone hoped that the rain would let up .
luckily enough the sun came out and everyone got set up to have fun .
it got hotter as the day went on and everyone got into their swimming gear .
the water was cool and everyone was excited to have a good day .
the couple on their honeymoom incurred a storm going thru the mountains .
they met new friends and were exploring .
when they got there the weather was good .
the lady was deciding whether to go in the water .
the man figured he would take advantage of the weather and just relax
the group of friends took a road trip
to the beach !
they played in the water ,
while some of the girls stayed on land to tan .
but one of the guys had a genius idea ; he could both be on the water and tan if he just floated around on his little blow up bed ! it was a great plan and it was a great day .
we took a road trip to the beach .
when we got there is was so sunny and bright .
then we saw people were already in the water .
after that we put on out bathing suites .
we even managed to get some sun .
the lighthouse stood tall and majestic .
they wished they were allowed inside .
the rickety , old fence showed it age .
the winds had taken a toll .
still , you could n't hope to see a prettier sunset .
we went out to the bay today to enjoy the weather .
the old light house is really impressive up close !
we love the beach and it is always so pretty !
we had a really good time walking around today .
we even stayed to watch the sun set . it was a very beautiful day !
the location lighthouse looks majestic from a distance .
it 's no wonder this couple wanted a picture with it .
after seeing the lighthouse , they headed off to the beautiful white sandy beaches ,
which are the perfect place to set up a tent and relax for a while .
the water was calm and they loved their little spot on the sand .
we got to the light house and relaxed for a bit .
we got some pictures up close and then headed back out .
we walked along the beach and found a good place to sit .
we spent the afternoon enjoying the day .
we ended the evening looking out into the awesomely beautiful bay .
while on vacation we found a light house .
then we stopped to take a picture under the light house .
we walked out to the beach .
we were do happy to be on vacation .
after that we watched the ocean for the rest of the day .
the project would soon begin .
we were installing these yellow mailboxes .
the bad rain came in .
we took a break .
we ended up leaving because the mailboxes flooded .
the party was at the beach today .
we had put out a lot of chairs on the sand for everybody .
it started raining .
we had to put everything away .
we decided to all go home instead .
the husband was thinking of what to do on vacation
they could not lay on the beach it was cloudy
there was a storm coming .
the couple decided to go on a cruise
they went deep sea fishing and had a good time .
the old man was ready to go out to sea .
he walked through the sand ,
and saw the waves rolling in the distance , and he knew it was time .
he grabbed his friends
and he got on a boat so he could finally be on the water .
we relaxed near the beach for a bit to get ready for our boat trip .
took a while to get to the boat with all the things on the beach .
the sky was cloudy but we had faith it would be okay .
we got to the boat and took our seats .
we shoved off and into the water to see the coast .
they were headed on the road trip
they decided to take an exit
and rest up in this town
and decided to get some food
and finally arrived at their hotel
the friends are driving through traffic to visit their friend .
after a long drive , they finally see the right exit
as they are driving , their friend waits for them and stares out her window .
the friends finally arrive at her door .
they decide to go out and get fried chicken for dinner .
the light turned green and off we went to our vacation .
before we got to the hotel , we stopped at a rest area for a picnic lunch but realized we had forgotten to pack sandwiches .
once we were settled into our room , i looked from the balcony to see if i could find a store to buy some sandwiches .
the guys said , `` do n't worry , we have a solution . ''
they left and came back with some great popeye 's chicken and biscuits for our very late picnic lunch .
the toll was already planned for , thank goodness .
we were relieved to see that we were almost to our destination .
we had n't a clue that it would be so busy .
popeyes provided us with a decently priced meal that was rather tasty .
we felt so small standing outside of this .
we headed into town to get a hotel room .
we saw our exit and got off .
once at our hotel , we all relaxed for a few minutes .
then the boys got hungry and we went to find food .
we ended up stopping off for some chicken .
the rock message on the beach told them the way to go .
they walked through the woods , crossing a creek using a fallen log as a bridge .
sometimes he wondered if they were going the right way .
when they reached the waterfall , she gave him a kiss .
there in the sand they found other rocks giving them a message about love .
i decided to take my girlfriend on vacation .
we wanted to go somewhere unusual .
this was the perfect place
they had really cool statues .
she and i had an amazing time together !
[male] drank his coffee to get ready for the day .
he and his wife were going to explore the japanese gardens !
they saw interesting flowers
and they saw interesting statues ,
but the best part about the day was that they spent it together .
we 're out on vacation and out on the beach we found these rocks stacked .
out on a hike , we find a nature made bridge over a small stream .
it was such a beautiful day that i had to take a picture .
we ran into a gorgeous waterfall and had to have a picture .
back on the beach , i thought it was pretty cool me and my mate find two heart shape rocks on the beach .
on our trip , we found some stones stacked on the beach .
then we walked through the forest and found a giant log .
we stopped for pictures in the forest .
then we came to a big water fall .
after that we found two stones that looked like hearts .
she stood on her tiptoes to get a better look .
disappointed , she gave up .
she longed to see the barge and the tug boat .
grandmother encouraged her to not to be cross .
she picked her up so she could get a better view .
this is [female] , she is 4 yrs old .
this is her first time on a boat .
she loves looking out the window at other boats in the harbor .
on her boat trip she saw some fantastic things .
her grandma was the one that took her on the boat ride .
the little girl peered over the railing to see the water .
she was sad she was n't tall enough to see it .
she wanted to see the boats floating around .
her grandma tried to point out to her a hole in the railing that she might be able to see through , but no such luck .
so grandma decided to just pick her up so that she could finally see .
took my daughter out to see the ocean .
we walked along the pavement until we got to a good spot .
you could see ships and a great view of the water .
grandma helped point things out to her for a while .
eventually she tired out and we headed home .
the family went down by the water .
the little girl was excited to be outside .
they saw a large cargo boat out in the water .
then grandma saw something else far out in the water .
the little girl was afraid to get too close .
our trip to lake michigand photos
this is a photo of me sitting on the beach of the lake
we passed through location on the way !
check out the names of the street signs
our last evening we enjoyed a wonderful american dinner
we took a tour of the organization 's factory today .
one highlight was meeting [male] the tiger .
and we learned something about sugar pops .
i wanted to take these pop tarts home !
we had such fun time on this tour . i 'm glad we went .
we had a great time at the organization 's museum .
[male] the tiger spoke to the crowd of adults and children .
we saw an old fashioned cereal box .
there were giant sized pop tart boxes . i hugged one .
i really liked the cornflake as a superhero .
the sky was foggy and ominous , not exactly the vacation atmosphere they had been looking for .
the next day was a lot better . they loved the sand and ocean , and it was n't too hot for fun .
location was all right . there were lots of trees to see , but they wished they had spent more time at the beach .
the city was very busy , and they were n't sure which way to go , because there were so many street signs .
she smiled and said she could eat her pizza with a knife and fork if she wanted to . it was her vacation too !
the wall was decorated
and the kids came to see the animal .
then they saw a museum with a box
and giant poptarts
and even a stuffed cookie .
he tied to write love you mommy in the sand .
he was so young he still could n't read or write very well .
his mother was his best friend .
he wanted to be able to draw in the sand just like her .
sometimes she would let him use her camera .
i took [male] down to the seashore yesterday .
he wanted to play chicken with the waves .
drawing in the sand was fun !
he wanted to take some pictures for his scrapbook .
we enjoyed spending time together .
i took my family to the beach yesterday .
my kid had a great time .
we took a lot of pictures there .
we saw some strange shapes in the sand .
afterward we went for a walk .
my wife and i took our young son to the beach today .
he walked along the water 's edge .
then we showed him how to write in the sand with a stick .
he wanted to take a picture of his sand drawings .
finally , my wife decided to pick him u so we could go home .
[male] had a lot of fun at the beach .
he loved playing in the wet sand .
later , we walked along the shore exploring .
there where shells and other stuff for him to discover .
afterwards , we headed back down the forest path from which we came .
i took this photo of this bird while on vacation
this was the long bridge that took us out to the swimming hole .
what a great view of the sunset .
i loved taking photos of the tropical trees
this is my favorite photo from the trip . i wish it never ended
he went to watch the sunrise .
a bird that was perched on a post caught his attention .
maybe he could get a better look he thought to himself .
he crept up the boardwalk , trying to not make any noise .
unfortunately , the bird heard him and instantly flew away .
the bird searched for food .
the dock was empty . only a bird landed on it .
the sunset 's views were breath-taking .
the palm trees stood tall .
the glistening sun stood out from in between the clouds .
a little bird stopped to watch us as we ate our picnic .
this is the pier on the lower peninsula .
looking out towards the setting sun from the end of the pier .
the clouds looked pretty threatening just before the storm .
here the sun breaks through after the refreshing thunderstorm .
the sky was very pretty
as the bird was up high
and looked down
at the bridge below
to see the other birds .
when i got to the beach it was a low tide .
the waves were far away .
there was no one else there .
after the beach i went to watch the soccer game .
it was very close .
before the soccer game , i walked along the outskirts of the town .
the scenery was beautiful .
there was plenty to see at the game .
i was rooting for my favorite team to win .
this was a great game .
it was a cloudy day at the sea
any clouds hovered above
the waves crashed onto the shore
it was time for a soccer match
the rain was surely to fall during the game
the family hung out at the beach early in the day .
they had a nice time .
after leaving the beach it was time to go to the game .
they were happy to be watching their favorite team play .
everyone had a busy day .
on our vacation , we went to the beach for a romantic walk .
the weather was nice and it was very enjoyable .
we went to watch a soccer match afterwards .
the match was intense and the fans on the seats were really loud .
we watched and enjoyed the whole game .
our resort was nice and relaxing .
we had the chance to lay out by the pool all day .
one night during our stay , we saw a live show .
the sunsets were amazing .
we will miss this beautiful land .
the family vacation oasis .
playing with her mother and grandmother .
spending the day at the beach , and going to dinner .
the family sat around a table and having a hawaiian authentic meal .
watching a luau dance performance .
we were so happy to be on our family vacation ...
even grandma was in our sun dress and ready to have a good time .
we walked the beach at nights ...
we drank during the late nights..
and , we danced the week away . what a vacation .
our island resort was all inclusive and it was so convenient .
we spent most days by the luxurious pool .
the hotel provided us with entertainment every evening .
there was a private beach for everyone at the resort .
my friends and i definitely recommend an all inclusive resort hotel . especially this one .
a view of the little hut we rented .
the pool was wonderful and so warm !
the dancers were so exotic , i had to scold [male] for drooling !
i captured that first sunset between two coconut trees .
we all posed for this after the show .
the area had many opportunities for artistic photos .
the symmetry in the structures was beautiful .
the way the sun shone on every day objects made many unique pictures .
even the living parts of the town had beautiful composition .
when looking at things from a different angle , you can find beautiful images .
my imagination always wanders . what was this board once a part of ?
what is this gate keeping out ? or in ?
who was this mysterious person ?
why was this park empty ?
and last but not least , where are all these people ?
we came across so many interesting things on our morning walk .
the ocean is always calm in the first light of the morning .
it 's a bit chilly out near the water , but a beautiful day .
we also walked through a nearby part . the leaves are gone so we have a clear view of the blue sky .
our photo collection shows how much we enjoy documenting everything !
the building was in terrible shape ...
it had started to show its age , rust everywhere .
old carts that had been used decades ago still stood loaded .
and , inventory that had been on the shelves was still there .
as we walked out , we were glad to experience the history .
while being outside , i ended up finding a snake .
walking alongside the fence by the ocean .
riding on a boat was a wonderful experience .
taking a nice walk in the park .
looking back at memories that had occurred in the past .
we went on a trip around the city at night to try out my new camera .
i was able to take a lot of good night pictures at the docks and river .
you can see the city further off in the distance .
as it got darker , the outline of the city became clearer .
until the sun came up and illuminated the whole scenery .
the sun was beginning to set , so i decided to go to the lake to watch it .
i arrived at the lake , and i found a dock to sit on .
the sun began to set fast and i was enjoying the calm atmosphere .
the city lights turned on and glistened over the water .
i even caught a shooting star .
the city at dusk had a quiet , soft look .
the piers reelected in the water were a pretty sight .
as it grew later , it was hard to make out what was on the other side .
the city is starting to light up in the background .
at last night has fallen and the city makes a reflection in the water that looks like flame .
it was a nice evening in the city .
the trees were dark and gloomy as the sun went down .
it became very calm in the city .
the lights came on and the city looked amazing .
from my house , the city looked like the most amazing place ever .
the night sky was beautiful behind the city .
they decided to eat and then go for a walk on the piers near the city .
the lights from the houses showed up as it got darker .
the view of the city by the water was wonderful .
they just sat holding hands checking out the night lights .
when i got to the beach there was no one else there .
the ocean was beautiful .
the weather was great .
the waves looked amazing .
there were a lot of cliffs on this end of the beach .
it was a beautiful day , clear as a dream .
locals had started a rumor that it a tsunami would hit .
no one believed it but without warning the sky started to darken .
the once blue sky became grey .
everything was shrouded in a haze and they could hear thunder not far away .
this is an area down in location that people like to visit .
there are a lot of tide pools to explore in low tide .
it can get cloudy at times but still the weather is warm .
this is the point sticking out into the water near the tide pools .
looking across there are rich green mountains where wild sheep graze .
last month i visited the moroccan sea .
the water was crystal blue .
on my second day there , it was really cloudy .
but the next day it cleared up .
i went for a lot of hikes along the cliffs .
the air was full of musk but the ocean was vast .
the waters were more blue than ever before .
the clouds came and gone , could n't decide whether it wanted to be a sunny day or not .
some areas looked like the edge of the world , a empty space of darkness .
others looked like location with its yellow rock surface .
we are headed to the short , it is our first vacation in 6 years .
riding along the coastline is so calming . i love the way the water looks .
we got a great rate on this condo for the week
the pictures we had seen previously do not do it justice .
day two we finally get to go relax on the beach , there is no one in sight . this is going to be a great day .
sitting at the house bored doing nothing .
might as well go outside and enjoy what the world has to offer .
the lonely road is nice and empty and ready to be driving on .
he views of the mountains are stunning when you truly look at them .
but nothing is more breath taking as he ocean . so calm and cool at the same time . what a great spot .
driving along this road its great to see mountains .
the coast line is simply breathtaking .
at home the house is naturally lit with sunlight .
the floot tiles are black and nicely put in .
the sunset on the beach is one of the most peacful scenes i know .
the road to our vacation stop . we are headed to the beach .
we finally made it to the beach and it is absolutely amazing . check out the water .
here is a picture of our condo by the water . absolutely amazing !
i do n't think i have ever stayed in a hotel room that looks so quaint .
the clouds the sand and the view is incredible here . loving my vacation .
the family was on their way to their vacation on the coast .
along the drive they could see the waves crashing against the rocks out side the car window .
they got to the condo they were staying at in time .
they decided to have their first dinner here at the table by the couch .
after dinner they went outside and walked along the beach .
some pics i took while driving around town .
this store is awesome ! items from the 50s , 60s , and 70s .
thought this building was neat . look how big it is .
another big building . this one is apartments .
just a quick stop for a bite to eat and i found this little shop . is n't that the neatest ? !
we were excited about our car trip south .
we could n't wait to get to location !
we had lots of choices for places to stay .
the high rise hotel looked great .
we decided to stay in an older hotel near the historic district .
there is nothing like a good old road trip to . i ca n't wait to see if there are any great antiques here .
if you did n't know , i am a lover of gently used things . this is one of my favorite vintage stores .
time to stop for a light lunch and i think this will hit the spot .
the sun is setting and it 's time to head home .
just one more stop for a small bite to eat at one of my favorite places .
we saw some great old location things while on vacation .
everything was so art deco , there was even a period museum .
the buildings were lovely .
our hotel was newer , but built to match the art deco around us .
there was a plastic food display in the lobby showing buffet options .
i went on vacation to location .
there were a lot of stores that carried old merchandise . i thought this one was particularly interesting .
here is the apartment that we stayed in .
this building reminded me a lot of the 60s .
i bought some fruit from this store and it was fresh and delicious .
we spent a lot of time at the beach yesterday .
all of the kids had a great time playing in the sand and water .
i brought my surfboard with me but i could n't catch any waves .
we also brought a skillet with us to cook up a meal .
it was very tasty .
he took the buckets to dig for clams .
they strolled down the beach hand in hand .
she looked out through the screened in porch .
when he returned , he had found enough clams for the entire group to dine on that evening .
after they ate , she decided to finish reading her organization organization book she had brought along on the trip .
we had a lovely day at the beach , and grandpa was carrying some red buckets for building sand castles .
we really needed some water to make the sand stick , so the girls went to the shore and carries many buckets back .
the water was really nice , and there were some people surfing in the choppy water .
we starting cooking some awesome fish that we caught from the ocean , and we cooked out on the beach .
we also found some really fresh oysters , which really topped off our wonderful meal !
a man is holding two buckets .
this is a picture of two people on the beach .
this is a picture of a house .
this is a picture of sand .
this is a picture of a book .
we had a family day at the beach .
the kids had fun making suncastles .
[male] even went out to surft .
we caught some fish for dinner .
we found some mussels as well . they were yummy !
today we took a trip to explore our local beach .
one fun thing we did was birdwatching .
we saw lots of birds !
we even got to watch a guy surfing . he was pretty good !
afterwards , we spent some time browsing in the nearby stores .
it was a nice day so we decided to go for a walk on the beach .
we stopped by the pier to get a better view of the ocean .
we watched a few surfers trying to catch some waves .
we even found some great information signs to help us identify all of the local birds .
after a while we started to get hungry so we head back to find somewhere to eat .
our family was lucky enough to visit location location this year . i loved walking on the long piers .
they had great informational signs to explain all the wildlife we saw .
the seagull thought he was king of the beach .
some brave souls were surfing , but i thought the water was too cold .
my favorite part was all the quaint shops in town .
i took a trip to visit the sea side this weekend , and walked along a pier .
nearby , i read a board telling me about the local wildlife .
i saw a bird perched on a old man-made object .
a man was surfing in the waves .
i walked down the main street of the nearby town to see what i could see .
the peer stretched out into the ocean .
the infographics on the peer showed the different types of birds you might see .
this bird was very common to the area .
surfers were used to seeing the birds .
tourists on the peer liked the birds until they tried to steal funnel cake from them .
the rain started early in the day .
by the mid morning i was stuck and could n't get home .
the floods had made the underpass unusable .
i finally found an alternate route .
the destruction was more than i had anticipated .
the recent flood really tore through my town .
the water was so deep the kids were literally swimming down the street .
the water rose so high it almost took out the old railroad bridge .
it even washed away half of the local campground .
through all the damage , i did manage to find beauty in this photo i snapped at the campground lake .
a really bad storm is forming .
it has finally started raining heavily .
look high high the water is rising under this bridge .
the town is beginning to flood .
check out how much garbage has washed to the shore from the storm .
be careful everyone . the waters are really starting to get high .
i do n't think i 've ever scene the banks go up this far .
do not pass !
more rain coming down . stay safe everyone .
what a mess this morning . luckily the water are receding .
people began evacuating the town at the news of the approaching storm..
the river began to rise as the oncoming rains poured down on the town .
boats could no longer go underneath , as the water came closer to the bottom .
the river spilled over the banks into the road , making it unsafe for driving .
after days of rain , the storm finally passed , leaving the town to wait on the waters to recede .
the reception was held in a beautiful banquet hall .
the entrance was hidden from view .
the old home was the perfect place for the wedding .
the back overlooked the bay .
we enjoyed beers as we watched the boats come in .
just got done setting up this table for an event at the collage .
these old collage buildings are creepy !
but the courtyards are beautiful !
went to the pier afterwards to feed some birds .
had some brews close to the pier , a very productive day !
before my friends got married , i took the time to walk through the reception hall .
their reception was taking place in an old venue at their college .
nearby was a nice park with benches .
i walked to the waterfront and looked out at all the boats .
i stopped at a seaside pub to buy a couple of beers before moving on .
banquet room in this old building was quite charming
i enjoyed seeing these old brick building
so much history going on here , these buildings are quite old
lots of sailboats in the marina , i wish i owned one too
golden light beer and dark amber , take your pick
this was the restaurant that we ate at on our trip .
this was the outside view of the building .
it was an old building that has been around for many years .
we ended up by the sea just to view the scenery .
we also had ourselves a couple glasses of beer !
after a 3 hours flight , we take the boat to get to our hotel in location location .
this is the magical view from our hotel room .
i could n't believe how beautiful st [male] was .
everyday , cruise ships made their way to the location with thousands of tourists .
this was my favorite street where i can go to traditional restaurant , then go clubbing in the same building .
we took a cruise this summer .
it was a big boat .
it was beautiful inside the boat .
we stopped at this small island nation .
we went shopping on the streets downtown .
here we are posing for our perfect picture on our vacation .
picture after our ferry ride we had a wonderful tour .
cant wait to get back to the other side . however , everything is beautiful here .
take a look at our amazing view . look at the mountains .
here is the small town . cant believe only one care can fit down the street at a town . definitely not in location anymore .
the couple signed up for a cruise .
the sailed on the blue waters past islands
they circled the island where they got a closer look .
the harbor was the most beautiful they had ever seen .
they were able to tour the colonial era village on the island .
my fiance and i went on a boat cruise .
the views of the water were so beautiful from the boat .
here is another picture of the view .
we were sad to debark the boat .
on the way back to the hotel i snapped some pictures . then we took some well deserved rest .
our wonderful view of the city from our ship cabin as we were leaving port
i loved looking out over the water at the beautiful views
[male] doing his first shot of saki
just the two of us in this photo
this is me being silly with fake eyeballs
she was a shopaholic .
she went to flea markets and thrift stores every weekend .
she went so often some of the people knew her name .
she bought some of the silliest things .
he did n't mind because she was his girl and he loved her .
she fixed the umbrella to maximize shade .
the town was full of locals selling clothing .
the colors were bright and there were numerous clothing to purchase .
she wore her extra large eyes today .
he decided to join in , and wear his funny eye .
[female] loved going to flea markets .
she never knew what kind of things she might find .
the idea of rummaging through items gave her a sense of satisfaction when she discovered something unique and different .
but [female] was busy having fun with some fake eyes .
and [male] prided himself in being the `` one-eyed '' tourist .
the lovely little town where we stayed for one week .
one day we took a ferry to the nearby island .
[male] tried some of the tequila while waiting for us to finish our appetizers .
[female] and [male] really enjoyed the trip to the island. ,
[female] plays with the goo goo eyes we found on the picnic table .
this is [male] , he is taking his family on a cruise .
he loves the style of bunk beds in the room .
the family is enjoying relaxing on the back of the boat as they leave port .
[male] is loving looking out one of the windows while they leave port .
his view is spectacular .
down highway 9 in location , there 's a really cool ferry .
[male] and [female] took the ferry , enjoying the foamy sea .
at the destination was a wonderful beach !
exploring , the two found an old lighthouse still in working order .
love came to them , there in front of that old lighthouse .
met up with my brother to go sailing today .
the inside of his cabin looks the same as it did 10 years ago .
he invited a few other family members too . i dont them very well .
looking over the side of the boat is pretty surreal .
the view of the land makes me forget all my problems .
[male] loved living on a boat ,
but maybe he could do without the ugly yellow decor .
he headed out to the first deck to meet his wife ,
but he got distracted along the way by the marvelous view .
man , it was great to be able to look out the window and see open water in all its glory .
we went on a boat trip .
our room had bunk beds in it .
we set sail and went so far out into the water .
then we just watched as the boat went further out .
after that we got an amazing view of land .
it was almost that time again
to light some fireworks into the night sky
the people were ready to see them
and the fireworks went off and everyone enjoyed them
this was the grand finally and everyone had a great time
the local lake announced a fireworks show for the 4th of july .
a lot of people gathered on the beachfront waiting for the display .
a man and woman sat on a blanket to watch the show .
there were many unusual fireworks like this one .
at the end of the show they had a grand finale of many fireworks at once .
went to the beach tonight and it was packed .
everybody showed up to watch the firework show .
me and my brother got the best seats we can find .
the fireworks started going off and it quite the sight .
the show went on for 20 minutes and was well worth it .
just before sunrise , we went to the beach .
as the sun came up , we noticed more and more people arriving .
it was fun to find good friends there , but we did n't know why so many people came to the beach so early .
what a surprise it was to be treated to an unusual morning show of fireworks .
the fireworks were loud and smokey , but especially beautiful in the early morning hours .
we went to the lake to watch the fireworks .
the sun was setting and it was getting close to being time .
everyone waited patiently for the fireworks to begin .
then they had so many different fireworks .
after that they had the grand finale .
nature is beautiful in the forrest
as well as the beach
and the water is always gorgeous
i love nature at all times
from top to the bottom
today we took a trip around the island .
we played in the sand and made designs .
we took a picture of it for our photo album !
we had a great time being together our in nature today .
we ended the day with a walk through the trail . i ca n't wait to come back .
we walked through a forest clearing to get to the beach .
we arrived out onto the shore and walked along .
we followed the rocks along to see the mountains .
we saw more forest and headed back in to get out of the sun .
we continued through the woods into the unknown .
out in nature i came across some tall trees .
at the beach i had some fun in the sand drawing before the tide came in .
exploring the beach i see a great view of ocean with mountains in the background .
behind me are these trees bordering the rocky beach .
heading back in the woods , the tree lined pathways amazed me .
we took a trip out in the woods .
after walking so far we came to the beach .
we could see other people far off in the distance .
then we got a great view of the forest .
it was time to walk back .
the crew decided to take a small trip to the coast to have some fun . this hotel is next to the bay .
this beach is a popular place for people to hang out .
[male] and [male] are regulars that hang out at the bay .
[female] and [male] have n't been here before .
as the sun set the four could n't be happier to be spending time by the water .
there is a little known island just south of location that is the crown jewel of romance .
my favorite place to stay is actually a very modern 5 star resort on a cliff overlooking the location location .
people flock to see the breath taking views and most all come in pairs .
you can find couples from all over the world by just looking to your left and right at any given time .
it is hard not to understand why so many come to enjoy the charms of this magical spot . i ca n't wait get back there someday .
we left the hotel and started walking .
we walked along the beach for a while during the evening .
we stopped and say to relax .
we stayed there for a while and watched the sunset .
a perfect view for a great day .
we went on vacation down by the lake .
the hotel we stayed out was amazing .
we sat and watched the sun set .
then we had a few pictures of us taken .
after that we stayed on the beach until it was dark .
moving to a new city made me worry it would seem crowded .
i was n't used to such big buildings .
but then i found this peaceful shoreline .
i made a new friend .
i found the sea provided plenty of serenity for my new life .
the day after the aliens came , people sought refuge at the beach .
it was abandoned for many years with old books laying everywhere .
there were hardly any people there with swings only a skeleton of what they used to be .
they went to the motel and gathered the survivors .
together they plan to defeat the space alien .
as we arrive on our adventure , we see the hotel
the hotel is very small with a few trees in front
as we arrive in our room , we take a look at our balcony
once we get settled in the room , we take a walk to see the palm trees
after sight seeing a little , we take a walk in the ocean .
this is the motel we 're staying at during our vacation .
there 's palm trees in front of the motel .
this is our balcony view .
the palm trees line out all the way to the beach .
the beach had a green , blue color .
this is a great area for a store or restaurant .
there 's so much work to be done here .
a little park could be built here for the kids to play in .
if the motel can be renovated the owner could make good money .
it vets so hot that you sometimes have to shield yourself from the sun .
a wrong turn on the interstate and we ended up an abandoned beachfront motel .
there was an old weathered phone book .
the swing set was missing its swings .
the motel itself had seen better days , with boarded up windows and long uncut grass and weeds .
my husband took the opportunity to photograph some of the ocean scenes !
[male] went on vacation to a local native american reservation .
there he learnt the history of the apache people .
he learnt of their suffering and the loss of their livelihood .
he also discovered that they were able to save some of the buffalo in order to continue the legacy of their heritage .
he was also able to see a traditional ceremony . that day for [male] was full of learning .
we were excited to attend the native american festival .
the costumed dancers were so colorful .
the beadwork on their head pieces was colorful and intricate .
the dancing was very exciting .
the dancers then invited the audience to join their circle .
the indian chief started the ceremony .
people from the village walked around in form with one another .
the head dresses they wore where special for the occasion .
the dancing and chanting started from there/
we all stood in a circle and chanted along .
a chieftain prepares for the festival .
women are dressed in colorful outfits .
this woman had her hair set up very nicely .
a young tribe member gets into rhythm .
lastly , tribe members are seen holding hands with the guests .
the guy was pointing where the indians were
and the indian could not believe it .
the skulls were old
but the bulls were still around
for the indians to have in the parade .
our tour walk of the beautiful beaches on vacation
i loved taking photography photos of the trees
here is another great photo of the sun setting beyond the trees
this is a very beautiful photo of the blue water and white sand beach
the last day ... this is me by yokohama bay .
we arrive in the ocean to get on our boat
as we ride on the boat , we see this bridge .
after seeing the bridge , our boatride takes us in the middle of the ocean .
as time goes by , we see a lot of office buildings .
at the end of our boat ride , we see a lot of palm trees .
they gathered around the water , wondering whether it was too cold to go for a swim .
they decided not to swim , but headed back to the resort , stomachs growling for a good meal .
after dinner , they took a walk , and were awed at the view through the trees . it was like a paradise .
they broke through the trees and found a quiet stretch of beach that looked like nobody had been there for a long time . the water was a beautiful blue .
the air was not as warm as they would have hoped for a beach vacation , but it was still fun as long as they bundled up in coats for their adventuring .
we visited the beach today .
there was a resort that accompanies the beach .
the view was fantastic .
the waters are blue and the skies are clear .
lastly , we took a moment to take a picture next to the beach .
we went to the islands for holiday
we got to see amazing sunsets
the palm trees were incredible
we got great seats on the beach
my mom wore her leather jacket
there was a lot of work to do in the shed .
all of the equipment inside was useless .
the beach was nearby .
i had to repaint the place .
there were some signs nearby .
this city was in need of defense .
the war is literally tearing the town apart .
many go by but not sure if they need to repasir something that will only be torn apart again soon .
two brothers hope to change this soon .
while another decides to change his fate and leave .
i visited location with my defense team last summer .
we were on a mission to help fix and rebuild the crumbling houses .
even the city center building is falling down .
two of the local people volunteered to help our team rebuild .
the used horses to help carry the materials .
i wondered if this was a warning of some kind .
the town was in shambles after the earthquake .
people were trying to go about their business afyerwards .
these young men helped to change my tire .
sometimes a donkey is more reliable than a car !
when i was in location i visited an old grave site with a makeshift metal cross .
as i got closer i noticed the extreme detail that was put into the cross .
across from the cross there was a wide open harbor with small ships .
walking down the road from the harbor i noticed a mural with a row of different flags .
next to the mural there was a sign , but since i could n't read spanish i was n't sure what it said .
there was a lot to do on our vacation .
the city was beautifully lit up at night .
the skyline at sunset was gorgeous .
we did make some time to leave the city , however .
it was well worth the trip to see the beach sunset .
we 're staying the weekend at the location location location casino .
the sun is setting soon .
farther away , the hotel lights make quite a scene .
driving further , the skyline contrasts beautifully against the hues of blue and orange .
escaping the city , we head to the beach to enjoy the sunset over the water .
we had a great time at the location location casino , but decided it was time to head out .
we had a beautiful view of the city as we left .
some time later , the city is so small in the distance .
after awhile on the road , we needed a break , so we stopped at the beach .
we sat and enjoyed a lovely sunset that evening .
i went to the hard rock cafe last weekend .
there was a beautiful sunset .
in the evening i slept at my hotel .
i waited for a long time .
eventually the sun finally finished setting .
at the location location location location .
city view from the balcony .
watching a beautiful sunset .
making foot prints in the sand .
sunrise at the beach .
i had a great time at the shore today .
there were a lot of animals .
we took plenty of pictures there .
the buildings were also amazing .
i had a great time there .
my boyfriend and i went to the beach .
it was very chilly outside .
we wanted to go down to explore the lighthouse .
we decided it was too far of a walk to get to the lighthouse so we took pictures from a distance .
we climbed further up the hill and enjoyed the view .
me and my husband went to a spot overlooking a local beach .
here we are , lovebirds .
the lighthouse was really cute up close .
it was also a really beautiful scene from further away .
i wonder how far that jet stream goes !
[female] and [male] could n't believe the views on their trip to location .
from the glens , where antelope and other grazers roamed free .
to the cliffs where waves crashed , harsh and cold .
even the hotel had amazing architectural sites .
they could n't wait to get home and show their pictures to friends and family .
landed on this island so we decided to enjoy the day here .
here we are , we found a light house .
here is the light house . it 's ok and withered but looks really cool .
here it is from a further distance .
top of the mountain !
it had been a long week at work so i wanted to get away from it all .
i decided to visit a lake that was about an hour away .
there were lots of interesting rocks there .
there was also quite a few beautiful flowers .
i grabbed my fishing pole and to my surprise caught three fish . this was just the break i needed .
after exploring the woods
i found so thing that i could niot explain
i also found peace in the place i was
i also foud peace in fishing
it was a builtful place
i do n't know what made this formation but it is cool .
these rocks formed in really strange ways .
this man was standing like this for over an hour .
i ran into this man fishing illegally .
the beautiful mother earth being beautiful once again .
i walked along the cliff .
glancing down i had a great view of the sea .
i came across stones that somehow got embedded in rocks .
the flowers looked as though their petals were blown out from the wind .
i made it down to the stream to fish for my dinner .
the man loved two things and one of them was geology .
he would study rocks all the time .
but , there was another thing he loved too .
he loved to fish .
he 'd go to his favorite location every weekend to do both .
there is an eco-resort where tourists can learn hands on about turtles .
the resort has an educational area with exhibits showing how turtles lay their eggs .
there is a schedule where visitors can see real loggerhead turtles hatch .
timely visitors are allowed to handle the hatchlings .
the real hatchling experience concludes when the turtles reach the ocean waves .
many baby turtles were on display at the museum .
we saw a lot of species of turtles
some statues of turtles looked beyond real .
there were even skeletons of baby turtles that did not make it to sea .
afterwards we walked out to the ocean to get a closer look at how the turtles traveled after hatching .
i had a great time at the beach .
i found a new turtle .
i bought him .
he was very small .
i released him back into the wild .
walking by the motel that we are staying at .
we end up going to a zoo and see a turtle .
here is the time of the birth certificate of the turtle .
look how small the turtle is i 'm about ready to hold .
after that , we go to the ocean and enjoy the view .
the kids arrived to camp .
they were able to find a turtle right away .
their counselor was able to teach them about it .
and then they were each given a stone turtle to keep
before going out to the ocean to sea the turtles swimming and nesting .
i heard about this awesome mini golf course/aquarium .
this was the waterfall hole .
they also had the super sweet octopus hole .
my favorite of all , the great shark hole .
but it was truly amazing to see everything while being underwater . what a fun trip !
the aquarium was absolutely amazing .
there were so many different specimens that they had there .
it took us a long time to walk across the entire thing .
some of the sea life did not move .
the jellyfish were very pretty .
the family decided to have a little fun and play some miniature gulf .
i love all the attention to detail they put into the different holes on the course .
this octopus is one of my favorite water features .
my daughter tries to ride this fish every time we come here
we ended the day with a visit to the aquarium nearby .
went to the aquarium , saw so many beautiful creatures .
dangerous sharks included , had fun watching the swim around .
the tube was one of the best , especially when they swam right over the tube , it was almost like being in water .
we got to see all sorts of different animals , not just fish . including this guy , or girl ... ok , this .
the jellyfish were beautiful , you could see them even with the the lights off them you could see them float and wave .
i went to an aquarium on the weened .
i was submerged in a tank . there were majestic sharks passing by . i was scared even though i knew i was protected .
people passed by on the walkway as i was diving in the tank .
this sea creature was a pretty purple , my favorite color .
i did n't get stung by these jellyfish thankfully but i did admire their beauty .
i invited everyone over for my son 's birthday .
he had a great time . we got him a cupcake .
my parents managed to make it to the party .
i also invited a bunch of my friends .
it was a lot of fun .
our first morning we decided to take a walk along the water .
it was still cool and windy that early in the day .
but after a little while , the sun came out .
so we were able to take in the sights .
and enjoy the beautiful place we came to visit .
check out the kiddies having their cupcakes for little zack 's birthday .
zack is amazed that he can not blow the candle out .
here is mom , pops and me before the wedding .
right before the wedding all the men gathered for photos .
what a ceremony , a quick wedding and we are off on the honey moon .
the morning brought a beautiful view of the harbor .
the northern air was so cold they needed to bundle up .
his favorite part of the trip was admiring the boats .
mom made friends with the local birds .
looking out over the water was satisfying .
i went on a vacation to the sea .
it was too cold to swim obviously but i was determined to get a picture at the beach .
my husband was happy to pose at the marina .
i thought this statue was funny .
the water was a clear blue . too bad it was the fall and i could not enjoy it more .
the archaeological site had many tunnels .
the place was surrounded by crumbling walls .
in the distance we could see the ocean .
we decided to take a break and go on a scenic walk .
the trail was surrounded by unique wild flowers .
about to enter the remains of what is left of a fort .
there are no more walls standing .
visiting an old fort by the seashore .
visiting a hidden cave and a secret passage .
man fishing on the rocks .
a group of friends and i decided to walk along the trails .
it was beautiful and i could n't help but take tons of pictures of the scenery .
we saw other people up ahead , so we decided to follow their lead to see what they were looking at .
while we were walking , we saw a huge hole that we almost fell into !
when we arrived at the destination , we were amazed at how clear the water was .
there had never been a dig in the particular site .
everyone was excited .
considering it was next to the cliff it could be dangerous .
the opening had to be braced .
security lines went all the way to the water .
the family was walking on a trail .
they found some pretty sites .
this spot was a favorite .
the kids had fun too .
the flowers were very pretty .
i went to the beach last weekend .
there were a lot of warning signs .
it was very sunny that day so i made sure to bring sunglasses .
we were fortunate to see some whales playing in the water .
they were a great sight to see .
our whale watching trip began in location location location .
it was a beautiful sunny day on the boat .
before we knew it , we spotted an orca .
a whole pod swam right next to our boat .
at the end of the day , we had some great stories to share .
one intrepid adventurer , sunglasses included both for dramatic effect and because it was sunny .
one bird infested sign notifying you of where we chose to adventure .
this adventure required a second adventurer ... again , sunglasses included for effect and sunniness .
we got to see orcas . so much bigger than expected .
it was surprising to see how well these two seemed to get along .
we went over the weekend to checkout the whales at the harbor .
we started off the day driving over an hour to the harbor .
once we got to the harbor we were greeted by a whale flipping in the water .
later in the day we saw multiple whales in close proximity .
at the end of the day we checked out the museum which had more information on the whales .
[female] and i went to the coast to go whale watching .
there were a lot of birds hanging out on the dock .
i 'm ready to hop on the boat and get watching .
a mother and daughter hopping around .
blowing air into the sky , making a bunch of noise .
this beach was beautiful at night .
it was a private hangout for the people who lived near it .
the kids liked to build sandcastles .
going out into the water was fun for the kids as well .
these two were happy that they got to spend time at the beach with their family .
i wanted to take a walk along the shore , even though it was getting dark . my mom said i could .
i brought along my dog for company and protection . her name is [female] .
it was getting dark , it was so nice , the water was calm and the little waves made a calming sound .
[female] and i climbed some dunes and watched the sun go down .
i 'm glad my mom let me take this walk . i 'm not afraid of the dark .
[female] enjoy her time at the beach digging in the sand .
hoping the dog will make a run for it . but he just sat still until someone chased him away .
[female] posing for her evening shot at the beach .
our nightly view of the ocean .
the perfect way to end the night with such a lovely view .
this is a picture of the ocean .
this is a picture of a kayak .
this is a picture of a little kid .
this is a picture of a girl near the water .
there are two kids in the water .
[female] enjoyed our beach vacation .
[male] had a blast at the beach as well . he took a rest from chasing seagulls .
we stayed at the beach until late .
we were sad to leave .
clouds started to roll in and it started to drizzle . finally it was time to go .
took a stroll on the backside of town.walked along the train tracks for a while .
come to a dead end road.at the other side was some small lake , more like a mud hole .
here 's the mud hole.wonder why they never cleaned it up and used it for fishing or something for the community .
lucky i got bast the train tracks in time as the train came by unexpectedly .
walked past the train track bridge and notice all the graffiti.never understood why people or kids would do such a think to someone else property .
warning sign . think i 'll just stay over here .
no access to the beach this way . might be a private area .
look ... it 's willy wonka 's ! !
not sure what this sign said at one time , but the sand on the beach has taken it over .
graffiti along the drive home . think i 'll keep on driving .
it is my hobby to explore countryside and visit different towns along the coast line .
recently i visited the town of dune acres .
there is a small river passing through this town .
there is no development on both sides of the river .
there is a small meter gauge railway line below the bridge in this town .
over the weekend the family went on a hiking trail by the railroad tracks .
although you could n't get to the beach from the trail it was still a very nice view .
we stumbled across this large pond in a clearing on the trail .
it was neat to see a train on the far side of the pond .
the trail ended where the train passed under a bridge .
the trail began at the abandoned railroad tracks .
they were not able to get to to the beach using this way .
they could see the water , but could n't get to it .
finally , they were able to reach the beach .
later , after the beach they stopped at a bridge that covered the abandoned tracks .
the happy couple is about to say i do .
the brides maids are emotional after hey say i do .
a couple shows they are extremely for the newlyweds .
the beautiful bride is nothing but smiles .
finally , the happy couple can eat these lovely treats after there big day .
[female] 's bachelorette party was out of control . the theme was western and we all had on cowboys . how we got up in the morning is beyond me .
the wedding the next day was held on a steam boat . the rocking and swaying did not help to settle my churning stomach .
the bride on the other hand looked absolutely stunning . her dress had just the right amount of lace to be unique and amazing .
as they said their vows , there was not a dry eye in the place.the setting had been set just right .
to end the evening on dessert was just the perfect icing to end the cake . the chocolate covered strawberries were cute as can be . the bride strawberry mimicked some of the same designs that we saw on the brides dress .
the bride and groom were high school sweethearts , and everyone predicted they would get married someday .
the bridesmaids became very emotional during the touching ceremony .
some of the bride 's relatives who were attending posed for a picture .
the beautiful bride posed for many pictures .

the food that was served on our train ride was delicious .

i really did n't want my photo taken on this day
i met this handsome guy my last day of vacation ... . too bad
she loved life and knew the possibilities were endless .
while she kept it real , she could n't help being a bit of a dreamer .
being a dreamer is what made her and [male] such a good couple , considering he was a dreamer too .
they traveled all over the country in their beat up , old van .
they saw a lot of the world in the side view mirrors .
as soon as we got to the hotel , i could n't wait to get to the beach .
luckily , the beach was in walking distance .
my boyfriend was excited to be on vacation with me .
we saw really cool trucks on the way to dinner that he really enjoyed .

felicia wanted to go traveling before she settled down to find a relationship .
she was from oregon and got all the way to montana .
she ended up finding [male] before she even was halfway through her trip .
they bought a van together and decided to travel together .
she ended up seeing a lot of the world and she did it with him .
`` look ! '' she exclaimed . i found a magic water bottle !
she led the group to the overlook where she claimed she had found the bottle .
she told them she had been enjoying the view , when suddenly it rolled right over to her .
she waited in the car as her friends searched for their own treasure , but was ready to leave . she knew there was only one magic bottle on this vacation .
she snuggled close to her friend , glad that she had made this trip with him .
she sat alone on the bus .
he pretended not to notice her as she listened to her music , oblivious to him .
he tried to concentrate on his book but he kept thinking of her .
after finding enough courage to talk to her , they spent the entire day together .
he picked a secluded area of the beach for them to get to know each other better .
last weekend [female] and [male] went to the beach .
they had to ride the bus for an hour .
but they finally got there !
[male] caught up on his paperback while [female] built a sand castle .
they had a great time together at the beach !

he finally got the picture right .
my boyfriend and i went to the beach on the weekend .
we set up the tripod to take this picture of us through the grass .
the sunset was really breathtaking .
i had to take off my sandals to enjoy the feeling of the sand on my toes .
it was time for the sun to set and time to go home .
once the beach ceremony was over the photographers took a few quick pictures on the beach .
the bride and groom were beaming with happiness .
you could tell the couple were truly in love with one another .
the sunset made for a perfect backdrop .

[male] and [female] always wanted a beach wedding .
[male] thought it would be a great to have a picture taken on the stairs leading to the beach .
after they said their i dos , they decided to stroll on the beach for pictures .
just before strolling off into the sunset , one last kiss as the sun went down .

they then take the cliche in the sunset pic .
my husband and i had a beautiful wedding shoot on the beach .
the dock showed a beautiful contrast to my dress .
we started doodling in the sand and the photographer snapped this romantic picture .
as the sun was starting to set , we enjoyed the last moments of light .
here we are walking into the sunset , literally !
my girlfriend and i went on an awesome vacation .
we started off at this great penis sculpture/people having sex place .
as you can tell she was not amused .
but we saw some ruins and hiked and she was happy .
she was completely worn out after the trip on the plane ride home . we had a blast .
[male] met [female] during a summer back home .
[female] was out of his league , but their shared interests made them fall in love .
they would often take trips to the beach .
and take detours to find unique wildlife .
encountering old ruins was one of their favorite past times .
us , the great adventurers , taking a photo for posterity , or so we remembered who we were .
wood art , and not ready , not ready for this picture , demand a redo , but the wood guy was totally ready .
how can you argue with that beautiful beach , even with cloudy weather , beautiful .
we thought about asking what sunscreen he used , but he just stuck his tongue out at us , some beach goers just do n't get the camaraderie .
stone housing , a little low on space , but the upkeep is very low . both beautiful and breathtaking .
this is a picture of a couple .
this is a picture of a woman next to a statue .
this is a picture of the beautiful shoreline .
this is a picture of a reptile .
this is a picture of old ruins .
[male] and i had a beautiful honeymoon .
these souvenirs were kind of elaborate and sensual so i had to take a picture . i did not buy any .
we did some hiking and i was not too happy about that .
but we did get to see these beautiful ruins which made it worth it .
it was a long trip home and i felt really tired but i think it was worth it for the memories i gained .
i took my car out on a road trip last weekend .
it was a long drive .
we finally made it to the beach and w took a lot of pictures there .
we had to leave , however , because of the approaching storm .
it was getting very windy .
our trip out to location this year was really wonderful .
even the fast food joints have beautiful ocean views .
our time spent at the beach was so relaxing , i can just hear the waves crashing on shore .
my daughter , [male] , made sure to take lots of pictures .
of course , we ended up buying too many souvenirs , so see you later alligator .
the woman went on a trip .
as the car was driven on the highway , the sky grew dark .
the woman played on the beach for just a little while so that she did n't have to leave without doing something and took some photos .
the sky grew darker and the clouds thicker .
the wind blew the flag on the beach so ferociously , the woman knew it was time to go .
there was a restaurant with a shark 's head entrance that we 'd never been to .
we decided to try it out , and found a menu board for patio ordering .
it was close to the beach , so we ate there .
i took pictures of my sister as she took pictures of me after we ate .
next stop , the alligator head restaurant .
on the way to the store , someone spots a junker .
they then drive over the bridge .
a stranger takes his picture .
he then sees a storm coming .
the storm makes the flag blow in the wind
we got to the park early in the day .
we knew that we had a lot of ground to cover to get to the waterfall .
luckily we found some new friends along the way .
the first glimpse of the waterfall took our breath away .
we never wanted to leave this magical place .
the rear of the canyon has numerous waterfalls .
a rainbow finds its way into the canyon mist .
the river has several falls cascading from it .
the raw power of the waterfall is immense .
the river below the falls now dons the rainbow .
the family went on vacation to a large park .
there was a nicely laid out map that they followed to find the best spots to see the sights .
they ran across this small creature that they had never seen before .
a trail lead them to this view which was one of the most beautiful views they had ever seen .
at the end of the day they found a waterfall that had a rainbow that went across the water .
people visit a national park .
they check out the map to decide where to go .
they come across an animal they 've never seen before .
the waterfall took their breath away .
a rainbow made the day perfect .
we 've arrived at the wildlife sanctuary .
the map sorta looks like an alien .
the wildlife here is n't afraid of humans at all .
the waterfalls are majestic and beautiful .
our story ends on a hopeful note .
we are taking a vacation at the beach .
we found a place near near the dock to have lunch .
we had a stroll after eating .
the water was beautiful .
we decided to change our clothes and go swimming in the ocean .
a couple arrive at their vacation
they seem very happy together as they arrive
the lady is enjoying her lunch on the river
after lunch , she takes a bike ride .
after the bike ride , the couple enjoys their time together at the beach .
this was our first vacation together .

finding water this blue is hard .
it was a nice sunny day on the beach . the sand was so hot .
i was excited about spending my day off near the water .
i started with a drink , overlooking the ocean , as i waited for my boyfriend to join me .
when he got here , we went for a walk and had someone take our picture .
we talked about one day maybe buying a boat and having lots of fun on it .

and , they caught a surfer on his board !
we decided to have fun today .

we seen so many places in our car .
we made sure to stop as often as we could to see the country .
it was an amazing trip and well worth the drive !
in the morning , we went to the water to get some good shots .
the stream wrapped around the entire plain .
there was a lovely pasture and gate entrance that we walked through .
we were so amazed by the beauty of the scene .
when we got back to the pier , we made a scrapbook .
took a ride and the views were gorgeous .
the vividness can not be captured by the camera entirely , but this is close .
the grounds were so green and lush .
and the terrain was so different than at home .
thought this rock cut out was interesting to watch the water through .
my parents sent me pictures from their drive up the coastline this weekend .
they saw a pier jutting out into the sea with a lighthouse on it .
nearby was a river that flowed into the ocean , and surrounding it was sharp cliffs and hills .
my dad took a picture of a gorge that ran right down into the water .
nearby , he found a hole in the cliff through which he could see the ocean beyond .
our boat tour of this far-away country started at this light house , which is still in service , lighting the way .
there are thousand of narrow lagoons that provide great views of the landscape .
this archway was built by conquerors who came here hundreds of years ago .
these ruins are said to be thousands of years old . they looked very mysterious .
this is the marina we stopped at . there we found a great seafood restaurant .
we stopped here to take a look at the scenery .
i wanted to walk to the edge this peer .
countryside was beautiful and still virgin .
this was the best photo from my trip .
such an amazing spot , i really enjoyed it
before we sailed off , we took a picture with the warning sign .
my cousins both joined me on the boat trip .
my nephew was also there and he brought his goggles .
i was in the water very quickly because i wanted to disobey the sign .
when we got back to the shore , we took some more photos .
my family and i decided to spend the day at the beach .
first we decided to take the boat out .
some of us we 're ready to jump in the water .
the water felt great .
some of my cousins were waiting on the rocks for us to come back .

my wife and i posed for a picture next to the skyline .
my son posed with my wife on the boat .
i dove into the water and went for a swim even though it was really cold .
on the shore , we walked over the rocks and made our way down to the water .
a family poses excitedly . they are ready for their boating trip .
mom and grandpa pose with the two young boys .
the two men and woman are enjoying their boating tour .
they stop for awhile and take a nice relaxing swim .
finally they arrive at their land destination and it is beautiful .
us on out family vacation . we were checking out the beaches while waiting for our boatride .
a pic of us on the boat going for a sail . it was a beautiful day !
my boy and i giving each other a hug !
we got to go for a swim off the boat for a bit , the water was warm !
after the boatride we checked out the reefs and rocks . everyone had a great time !
it was quite a sight staring out at that ocean .
just watching this climb made me nervous .
this place had quite a lush landscape .
look , i 'm king of the mountain !
the water was so incredibly blue .
i chose to go to a mexican beach for vacation .
the day i went the skies were very clear and sunny .
a little closer to the beach now , the scene is very pretty .
i found a good lookout spot .
i was tempted to climb higher but the cliff was a very steep and treacherous .
my friend and i went rock climbing near the ocean this weekend .
i took pictures from safety as my friend climbed up the near-vertical wall .
from my perch , i could look out over the vista and see the water .
when my friend made it to the top of the cliff , he posed for a victory shot .
from up above , we could look down the coastline far away .
exploring a region i 've never been to before .
rock climbing what a thrill it is and i have such a clear view .
where the land and sea meet , how beautiful .
standing and enjoying the view and the smell of the sea .
standing atop and looking out , what a great trip this has been .
here 's the view from my rock climbing adventure .
my best friend and fellow climber told me to put down the camera .
this shot was on our way down . we wanted to climb closer to the water .
this guy called us crazy as we climbed again directly over the ocean .
it was totally worth it . we stayed up here for the rest of the day .
during my trip to location i went to this beautiful location location .
in the lake they had these natural rock formations that looked like animals .
the entrance to the buddha garden temple reminded me of a hobbit hole .
inside were tiny buddha statues along the pathway .
right before we left , we stopped to rest at the yin-yang pavilion .
entering the city seemed like stepping back in time
the water features were a beautiful backdrop for the modern buildings
the yin yang symbol has been a chinese staple for years .
the unique entry to the garden was our favorite .
the baby budah greeted us as we entered .
we started with a stroll around the lake , looking at the beautiful rock formations in jutting from the middle of the lake .
they were some compelling shapes
we then decided to head over to the temple , and we noticed a ying yang symbol right before the entrance .
as we approached the gate , we were amazed by how scenic it looked through the circular entrance .
there were statues of little children placed all around as guardians of the temple .
the park is quiet and beautiful at opening time .
the rocks reflect a gorgeous reflection on the water .
a small hole is made as a doorway to the picnic area .
buddha rests by the side of the water .
a yin yang represents all of humanity and is a reminder for all in the park .
monument park is a great place to visit for the day .
there are statues of all types , including this frightening creation rising from the water .
the huge circle acts as portal to the park , creating a feeling of it truly being separate from the rest of the city .
as you walk through the park , you notice the many intricate statues , including this leaving buddha .
this ying yang sign truly represents how the park coincides yet is separate from the surrounding area .
the beach was more beautiful than words can describe .
the architecture was amazing in these buildings
it felt surreal to be inside such a place .
we found the perfect spot in the sand when the sun came out .
this was a spectacular view that captured the essence of this place .
this was the first picture i took after landing at our vacation spot .
we stayed in an old town full of charm and friendly people .
we explored some of the older buildings .
i liked this one the best , especially the fountain .
but mostly , we just relaxed on the beach and enjoyed the view .
i took a vacation in location this year , and took pictures of everything i saw , starting at the airport .
i went up the hills and took pictures of an old town .

there was a fountain in another courtyard that was especially beautiful .
nearby was the ocean and a lovely beach that was nearly deserted .
the couple arrived at the beach that morning for their honeymoon .

we had such a lovely time that day !
the van sputtered then stopped .
oh no , what a place to run out of gas !
there was no cell phone service .
they realized one of them would have to walk .
he still had n't returned by midnight and she was terrified there all alone .
we were driving into what looked like a storybook . beautiful trees and mountains in the distance .
entering the wooded forest , we escape reality for awhile .
winding roads up these mountain hills keep us on our toes . we are keeping an eye out for the wildlife !
we 've almost made it to the campsite . organization organization is the perfect name !
here we are ! the sun is setting , we made it to our spot . it will be a great night and the start to a wonderful vacation !

it was very tiring .
when we go there we went sailing .
we had a great time .
we packed up and headed back home .
on the road , driving to our perfect spot on the seaside .
this boat was broken but we got it working just in time !
our captain was a very good teacher !
the sail catching the air is what pulls us forward .
after the day is over we pull the boat up to the car .
it was a long journey from our home .
both sons slept in the car .
when we got there , we sailed for a bit .
the water was so clear .
there were other people that brought boats too .

mr snuggles here came to see us off before we left for our day trip .
the view was amazing at the beach , i can just stare off into it for hours .
here we are taking a picture together in front of the picturesque ocean .
i couldnt keep my eyes off it , there were lots of great views from this pier .
such a mysterious lighthouse but we will have to save that for our next adventure .
we found a cat on the way to the ocean .
we where excited to go .
the ocean was beautiful .
there was a lot of walking you could do around the ocean .

mg cat loves the sun .
my wife prefers the shade .
i like to spend most of my time on the beach .
the beach and shore neighborhood is so precious .
my friend posed in front of the beach for a photo .
here is kitty right before we left . she is not normally social , so it was nice to see her .
the sky looked so good on the beach . it was hard to see where it ended and the water began .
me and greg right at the edge after parking . i think he rather enjoyed himself .
you can see that some of the beach had eroded away , and a wall had to be put up .
in the distance we saw this light house . i wanted to go and see it but greg thought i was a bad idea .
a couple was going for a walk when they saw a cat on the sidewalk .
next , they found a wide , open stretch of sea .
they decided to take their picture in front of it .
the man took a picture of the woman enjoying herself on the pier , as well .
finally , they decided to head out to the lighthouse to end their day .
during our anniversary date . we enjoy the food so yummy .
another seafood that complete our day .
relaxing after the heavy meal we had eat .
a nice view on the river side while relaxing .
what a peaceful place to live or hanging out with family .
then my friends and i , stopped at this local restaurant to try their lobster , which was great by the way .
the beach looked pretty calm in the morning
i decided to go the beach even if it was n't sunny .
i decided to venture on a boat trip which was really interesting .
we also had this delicatessen of their traditional dish , which was a bit scary but tasty .
the family enjoyed the dishes together .
the main entree was delicious .
she enjoyed a nap in the swing after eating .
the view of the lake was astounding .
the water leading into the town was brown .
when we visited , our hosts served us delicious meals every day .
every meal was a bit of an adventure .
we slept in hammocks which i loved .
we could see the water from their house .
it was too polluted to swim in .
i am having a vacation with friends at a restaurant and a beach .
awesome food for dinner .
the hammocks were comfortable .
the views were great .
the water was calm and pretty to look at .
a couple went on a trip hiking .
they liked the isolated nature of the area but liked to have the comforts of home near .
they were able to fish on a peaceful lake .
they saw beautiful flowers .
but most of all they enjoyed the beautiful scenery and felt awe at god 's creation .
i loved my vacation this year !
look at this beautiful photo i took of location location 's
these beautiful pink flowers were along the trail we walked
we took a 40 mile hike up to this mountain range
this is my last photo and favorite from the whole trip
we sat across a lake near a mountain .
we got up and decided to explore .
the crazy looking flora caught my attention first .
then the vastness of the open plain .
we stopped by a lake before continuing on .
the raft the men had whipped up made continued to float down the river .
cold grey mountains flanked them on either side of the river .
when the men spotted flowers stubbornly growing between the cracks of the rocks they felt inspired . they would n't let the river 's freezing water dampen their spirits .
just before their raft deteriorated completely they finally found a place where they could make landfall . a dirt path stretched out before them .
after many hours of following the path the men found themselves in an idyllic glade . the men smiled at each other before looking behind them to the crates they had brought with them . in this remote wilderness the men knew that the parents of these children would never find them .
went out for an amazing hike today . thank god for vacations .
can you believe this place ? it just looks amazing .
the water looks like something made just yesterday . none of that city dirt .
there are n't that many flowers , but the ones you find are really beautiful .
when fairy tale meets real life .
i got the chance to stay at a tiny island resort .
with white sandy beaches and crystal-clear ocean it was a paradise .
we got the chance to go on a jungle exploration .
we follow the path through the jungle . lead to an old monastery .
we got back to the hotel just in time to watch the sunset , it was a great day .
this house is surrounded by water .
the architecture of the house is very modern .
this is one side of the house .
the house even has a large reflecting pool .
the natural beauty of the surrounding property brings up the value .
during my hike i came across a small creek . i decided to take a dip and cool off
later i took cover under a parking garage
no cars were parked there . then i realized it was the weekend and people were not at work
in the distance i could see a large out door pool .
after i rested i continued on my journey and passed a really beautiful waterfall
todays trip to the incan ruins was both educational and enjoyable .
we started the day at the shore where we went out on a small fishing boat .
we enjoyed swimming in the ravine afterwards .
the tour included many historic buildings that we had only read about .
at the end of the day we watched the sunset under a clear purple sky .
we went to location to enjoy the tropical weather but when we arrived it was pretty gloomy .
the weather really was n't even nice enough to enjoy the beach .
instead , we spent a lot of our time exploring other parts of nature .
we even took the time to go to some old ruins .
finally , by the second week of our trip , the sun was shining bright and we spent 8-hour days on the beach .
my sister , [female] , lying on the sand , at the beach .
[female] and her boyfriend , rob , standing by the shore .
[female] , still taking in dreamland , in the morning .
this is the condo where we stayed , during our trip to location .
[female] having late breakfast with bread and jam .
we honeymooned in the medeterainean this summer .
we got to explore castles .
the beautiful inlets were perfect for sunsets .
our bed was comfortable .
we were treated to breakfast in the mornings .
my girlfriend and i took a vacation to lay on the beach for a few days .
we posed for a picture on the tile walkway next to the water 's edge .
we slept in a cozy bed and breakfast with a crazy quilt .
the building we stayed in had a balcony that ran all the way around .
in the morning , we had our own kitchen to make breakfast in .
[female] did not like [male] taking her picture .
she no longer loves [male] , but wanted to go on a free vacation .
this is where she pretended to have an orgasm .
this is the mediocre house [male] rented for the week .
the 1970s decor did not impress [female] and she murdered him in his sleep .
the couple was on vacation .
they started by going to the beach .
they checked into their bed and breakfast .
there was a beautiful view from their room .
then they ate dinner .
we headed to the rustic dock for our ocean life tour .
even though there were lots of boats , ours was easy to find .
once we got a little further out , i thought i saw something on the rocks !
i did ! there were the seals i had been hoping to see , all lounging around on the same rock !
this one even came by our boat to say hello ! it was the best vacation ever .
this dolphin greeted us this morning , joyfully .
the birds were waiting for lunch .
how cute is this pier ? it had many fishermen out today .
the marina was also filling up fast with sail boats .
stopped here and had a quick snack before hiking along the rocky water side .
i visited an old waterfront town that is now a tourist destination .
there are boats there , where they will take you out on the water for a fee .
i walked down the beach and took pictures of the rocks in the surf .
off the shore , there was a little rock populated by birds .
a sharp rock pointed out of the water below .
we started out by the dock looking to catch a boat .
we we 're in luck and spotted one that was taking people out .
the waves of the ocean looked awesome from the boat as we went past .
came up near some rocky formations that the boat would not get to close to .
then out of nowhere , a dolphin popped its head up . a great way to end a boat trip .
at the docks getting ready for a boat ride .
off we go onto the great big sea .
how lovely it is , with the good clean fresh smell .
looking at the birds on the rocks .
getting to see all the creatures of the deep .
enjoying myself and strolling to relax .
arriving down the long road to a quiet place to relax .
the attractions are all around and in walking distance .
the water is aqua blue and findings of the earth is breathable .
leaving the destination is the hardest part of this magical vacation .
me and my brother drove into town on the last day of our vacation .
we stopped at a good place to eat .
before we left to the airport we decided to go sightseeing one last time .
we took some great pictures by the mountains .
the view of the mountains and the beach was stunning .
my brother and i decided to take a road trip , and drove up the coast .
we saw a small town near the water and drove down the main street .
at the water 's edge i took a picture of my brother near the beach .
he took a picture of me facing the other way .
up the coast , we could see magnificent hills rising from the water .
[male] was excited to be out of the city . the company 's hq was in a beautiful town .
at the headquarters the grounds were kept clean and trimmed .
coming to this building was fun for the workers who lived in the city .
the beaches in this area were picturesque .
the town was small but the local restaurants were world renowned . [male] wished he could work at this location .
standing along the coast line while on holiday .
taking the long walk between the trees to see the building at the end .
getting ready to do a little exploring in the countryside .
gazing out to the sea and just thinking .
downtown to do some shopping and sightseeing .
we decided to spend the afternoon at the boardwalk .
i went to one of my favorite stores called pandora 's box .
when we were done shopping my daughter decided to join the band while they were playing .
my husband and his brothers were waiting for us two bring lunch .
my son and his friend decided to play basketball while we shopped and got lunch .
my family and their friends are getting ready to have a barbecue at the park .

a building near the shore had an advertisement for altoids .
a band was set up on the street , and a little girl danced to the music .
nearby , a group of people sat on benches eating their lunches .
a basketball court had been built right by the water and was in use .
it was a monthly celebration in the city 's square .
kids and adults loved these gatherings .
the band played songs every month that the kids loved to dance to .
getting some shade where they could find it kept the residents cool .
most of the people gathered near the beach to get cool but some people decided to play basketball .
the couple was taking a vacation in location .
they came upon a skate park .
they stopped and watched the skaters and listened to music .
the park was very busy that day .
afterwards they went to the other part of the park to play basketball .
i rode my bike all the way home to talk to my mom .
she bought a new keyboard but i told her that the internet was boring and nature was fun .
i took her outside to view this lovely flower .
she said she preferred the beach so she took me there .
we saw so many adorable dolphins at the beach section .
got a new camera and decided to take it to a dolphin show .
i ended up getting some good shots of the dolphins and trainers .
but my favorite is the macros .
here is the new camera . gosh , i love it .
these are my other two loves , coffee and cigarettes .
i decided to take a trip on my motorcycle to the coastline .
it would be interesting to write about it on my blog later .
the flowers there were amazing to look at .
the water looked so nice .
i then took a boat out so i could enjoy it .
i went to see a water show performed by dolphins this weekend .
one of the trainers rode on the dolphin around the pen .
nearby , i saw a gorgeous flower i had never seen before .
later , i experimented with my camera and took a still-life shot of another camera .
i did the same thing with my organization cup and my cigarette i was enjoying .
i said goodbye to all the toys in my office cubicle .
this keyboard wo n't be used for a week .
my wife wanted a flower picture , it was the first i took at the resort .
the hotel was all inclusive and this view was part of the package .
swimming with the dolphins was on my bucket list ! it was the highlight of our vacation .

she was inspired to take a panoramic picture from the reflection on my sunglasses .
she was enjoyed the decadent lifestyle while we were there .
my girlfriend and i went to a lovely beach this weekend .
i took pictures of her as she lounged in the surf .
at night , we sat on the beach and took pictures under the moon .

it was time for a swim with friends .
after , we found this wonderful flower .
the flower had an insect on it .
it was a foggy day , but it sure was scenic .
the rocks in the area looked very unique , like volcanic rock .
the view from up high made it seem even more beautiful .
some surfers were out that day taking advantage of the good waves .
i love these types of colorful flowers .
there was an eerie glow to the day .
the mountain peak was so amazing to see .
nearby , the water pushed in and out .
we could n't resist playing in it for awhile .

a man had the day off , so he was thinking about what he could do outdoors since it was so nice .
he decided that a day at the beach would be the perfect way to enjoy his day off .
he rented a boat and went sailing , happy that he was actually on the water instead of on the beach like most people .
he sailed around the water , looking at things like the pier where people fished .
after returning his rental boat , he sat on a bench and looked at the others enjoying their day too .
the beautiful curved island .
this is the boat we will go out on later .
this is the beach right in front of our hotel .
the cute little cat that came from nowhere .

i decided today was a great day to get out and get some sun .
got to the beach and it could n't be more perfect .
down the shore , you could see people everywhere . apparently they had the same idea as me today .
went down to the pier to gaze out at the sun as the day grew on .
finally saw a small boat before i left that had a few friends in it i knew from back in the day .
while on vacation i attended a river parade .
some of the float had floats .
other vehicles were powered by regular wheels .
some were powered by water wheels .
others looked more like boats .
this was so much fun . we went to an event where people made their own land/water vehicles .
people were so creative , i could n't imagine drawing up an idea like this .
the boat was so classic , but beautifully done .
the people using the kayaks had the right idea .
i really think they need to make this a unicorn , my children would love that .
i went camping this weekend near a lake .
a group of people had made the most ridiculous paddle boats they could .
this one was shaped like a car that was floating on the water .
another was shaped like a giant wheel that went around and around in the water .
i was most impressed with the one that took on a sailing ship motif .
the `` silly boat show '' was an attraction that everyone loved to participate in and watch .
working on their boats for a whole year meant a lot of creativity was put into the boats .

the second and third place kites were both quite large too but everyone agreed they were n't as cool as the lobster kite .
its the annual kite competition at our local beach
kites of all shapes and sizes ... .even super hero kites .
even the local sea life got in on the act .

had to get a picture of the sign , we explored that bridge .
a look at the beautiful ocean .
this is our cute little rental vehicle .
we could n't help it . we had to take the scenic route .
when we got to the house , we had to rush out to the beach .
i really love this picture of my family by the sea .
among all the sites we came across , we could n't help but take this shot of the two puppies .
he family posed for a picture before embarking on their family trip .
the beach was beautiful even though it was a bit brisk outside , a warm flannel get her nice and toasty .
the beach and the shore line was a nice stop photo op !
the family decided to visit the historic bridle and did not want to is the eagle river falls .
the waves were quite big and magestic , this photo will be a nice addition to the family album .
dad had really been looking forward to the trip .
he loved to go fishing .
something about being on the water he said .
it certainly turned him into a different fellow .
i suppose all his troubles went with the tide .
this plane was flying so incredibly low .
it was amazing how fast it could change elevation .
i could n't believe how close they were flying in proximity .
they put on quite a show with their moves .
this was at the end . we sure got our money 's worth .
its a bird , its a plane , its ...
the blue angels ! !
they are amazing pilots . look at this synchronized flying .
they were so fast . one minute high , next , super low .
sometimes they just pop outta nowhere .
i went to an air show and saw a bunch of fighter planes flying overhead .
one went very high in the air and was hard to see .
three others flew in formation together over the city .
they flew really high above the city and were hard to see .
finally , they banked around and came over for one final pass .
it was a cloudy day while we watched the air show .
first , there was a single plane doing stunts .
then that plane was joined by three more jets .
all four of them performed tricks in the air .
they even did a loop midair !
today was a beautiful day for an air show .
the jets were brought out to display in the show .
they would fly together to do some pretty incredible things .
it looked to serene to see them in the air together .
it was a very beautiful show .
my brother , [male] , standing by the rail , and posing for the camera .
there was a lot of steam coming off the ground , which is considered a volcanic region .
during lunch , we had barbecued chicken , and potato salad .
[male] and his friend , [female] , making a lot of jokes , during our trip to the park .
this is the hotel we stayed in during our vacation .
on the last day of our trip me and my brother decided to go out for one last meal .
while our order was being cooked we decided to take some pictures in the meantime .
we were so hungry we ate our meal in less than 2 minutes we left the leftovers for the birds .
once we were about to leave i took this last picture of our tour guide next to the cool plane .
i was kind of sad to leave it was a great trip .

having dinner outside with an unexpected guest .
two friends on vacation enjoying nature .
having a picnic outdoors with friends and family .
my mom used to take us to a place my great grand father helped build called barley estate .
i slipped away one day and found a cool little watering hole so i decided to slip down to my skivvies and take a refreshing swim .
i came across this opening in the rocks that looked like something from a [male] potter movie .
i peeked through and was disappointed to just find a normal river with people on the banks of it .
i put my clothes back on and shook the water out of hair and headed down a new path i found along the river and hoped it would take me somewhere exciting on my way back to the estate .
spelunking was their passion .
they traveled all over the country to visit various caves .
sometimes they had to swim under water to get the main cave area .
most of the big caves they had found did have water in them .
when they found a dry cave they would often camp in it .
the houses and most of the buildings are very old .
some of these waters are healing waters .
there are caves that look out onto trees and sky .
the trees are green and healthy and the water is clear and fresh .
this place is like a hidden paradise .
they had heard rumors about the magical properties of this place .
so they decided to visit . it was a little scary to look down so far into the gorge .
they hiked carefully down into the rocks and discovered a little known pond in the formation .
someone suggested that they might even find gold in this place if they searched hard enough .
they were n't sure that was true , but their tired feet felt amazing after they dipped them into the clear , pure waters as they admired the overhanging trees .
we went up to the caves today .
there was even a flowing river through the caves .
it was a fascinating thing to see !
the water ran through the entire cave system .
it was a very beautiful sight !
the morning started with just a couple of people on the beach .
as the day wore on , more people arrived .
it is still morning , but the beach is becoming crowded
people are even building shelters to avoid the beating of the sun .
not only are they protected from the sun , the screens keep the bugs out too . these folks know how to enjoy the beach in comfort !
the production team was happy they would be filming the music video at the beach .
they set up a place for the staff members to relax while on break .
most of the staff was just happy to sit around on the sandy beach .
[male] , the producer watched the playback of the video under the protection of the canopy .
at the end of they day , they watched the sun go down .
it was a perfect day for a party on the beach .
my friends began to arrive one or two at a time .
before i knew it , we had a small crowd .
the guys quickly set up their sound gear .
but the generator was out of gas . everyone was bummed !
my friends and i went together to hang out on the beach one weekend .
we set up a large tent , but mostly played out in the sun .
some friends set up their own chairs and sat facing the water .
others decided to get out of the sun for a while and just hung out in the tent .
as the sun was going down , i walked down the beach and took a picture of the ocean .
the beautiful beach , taken from hotel room .
everybody just hanging out on the beach .
everybody hanging out on the beach and me walking to go get a drink .

listening to the band play in our screened room .
during our shopping trip we stopped at a toy store .
the had a few action figures .
they has these little stuffed animal key chains .
they even had ugly dolls !
we were n't able to figure out what things thing was .
so while we were out of town , i had to take a few pictures of these strange items i found in this shop .
stuffed , pirate block head with a yellow nose , keychain ?
the face on this doll was a bit horrifying .
double punch was the name of the store .
and these earrings were actually adorable .
we found some awesome stuffed toys in a cool little shop .
we really liked the eyepatch toy .
this statue was vey cool indeed .
double punch is such a neat little shop .
cat and chicken rings !
today i decided to take a trip to my local toy store and see what they have .
i found a small group of action figures that would look great in my room
i also found some cute key chains i could add
i really enjoyed these small toys .
i bought this penguin for my niece because she loves the animal .
the toys are on display through the store window .
the toys are lined up nicely on the shelf .
toys are hanging from the pegs .
toys are neatly lined up in boxes .
stuffed animals are laying down on the shelf .
i love vacation so much and taking pictures .
i actually got a picture with me in it , proving i was out there .
the water was so enchanting .
the waves were crashing so hard and so loud , it was mysterious .
i thought this rock was so cool the way the water had formed it .
[female] decided to take a trip to location , location .
she took pictures of the wild flowers .
after climbing a steep cliff , she took a perfect instagram shot of a tide pool .
the sky started getting darker around her and she decided to call it a day .
not before taking one last shot of the murky waters .
the coastal wildlife was diverse and beautiful .
reaching the top gave us a spectacular view of the ocean .
the sound of crashing waves was very relaxing .
the waves threw up fantastic amounts of spray .
the impression on this rock looked a bit like a sea turtle shell .
[female] went on a hike to the beach .
we stopped and looked at these beautiful flowers .
check out this awesome view from the top !
as we got closer to the bottom , you could really see the waves .
we finally made it ! time to relax !
while it may not look it , mom was very excited to visit the coast for the first time .
the welcoming lavender was the first thing she saw . this is one of her favorite plants .
the view as at above the tidal pools . she was a little bit worried about how far it looked .
but she made it . she commented on how nice it was to feel the breeze .
she was amazed at how big the ocean seemed . she also loved hearing the crashing of the waves .
we went to the wrong store for tractors .
the first and second tractors were good for the job .
the black tractor was the most efficient .
we bought the black tractor after a consultation .
we brought it home to be put to work .
so we got a new tractor at work today .
the scoop is way bigger than our old one .
the tires are really large .
and , its a lamborghini !
here it is from the back hauling our green machine .
i did n't realize there was such a thing as a lamborghini forklift , but i got the chance to drive one the other day .
it looked more or less like a regular forklift .
i guess it was a little more attractive .
now that i think of it , it was pretty sleek and stylish .
to top it off , it appears to get the job done .
i was shocked to discover this company makes more than fancy sports cars .
they make tractors as well . i did n't think anyone would believe me without the photos .
here 's proof that a lamborghini tractor is real .
this is for the most stylish contractor or wealthiest farmer .
actually it looks no different than a [male] deere .
i 'm a lamborghini . not a sports car lambo , a true lambo on the farm .
my speed is unparalleled . i have my trailer for extra company when i smoke everyone else .
as you can see from my tires , i do a lot of work . dirty work .
did i mention i also have a nice bucket ? other tractors wish they could dig as good as me .
my favorite part of the job is burning my rubber in fresh dirt . i love the feel of dirt in my wheels .
my friend , [female] , is upset about going out into the snow .

we spent the whole evening deliver toys and food boxes .
helping others makes you feel great !
a group of friends and i decided to have a little fun over our christmas break .
some of my friends do n't enjoy having their picture taken .
but others do , especially when they 're wearing awesome santa hats with blonde pigtails .
we had a lot of fun moment dancing in the street and being silly with each other
by the end of the night we were so tired that we eventually passed out where we fell
it 's christmas holiday and my friend said she needed to get out of the house and wanted to go have fun !
we all went out to find something fun to do .
we donned some hats to celebrate the season .
she felt a little tipsy and was dancing .
finally , we needed a break from the festivities and decided to sit down .
one day i took a long walk through the town to see an old lighthouse that had caught my eye . i knew it was by a grouping of trees .
on my way there i walked along the beach , which had few people around due to the colder weather .
having gotten to the lighthouse , i admired its stripes from the outside first before venturing inside .
i climbed the stairs to the top , where i could view the huge light . it had so many mechanisms associated with it , i could barely understand how it turned on and off .
on my way out , i noticed some signs plastered around the building ; their age indicated how long they had been up . it was an interesting day .
the beach is a fun and safe place to vacation .
the safety of the beach and boats is provided by a light house .

there is a group of people lining the streets .
a little girl in pink watches the race .
the bikers finish up and watch the remaining ones .
i watched my cousin mohammed participate in his first triathlon .
i was amazed to see all the men running with their bicycles as if they didnt understand how they worked .
my other cousin , [male] was also participating in the triathlon . as he rounded a corner he nearly fell off his bike .
he righted himself and sped up , pulling away from the crowd .
[male] finished first , and much to mohammed 's shame , he finished in last place .
it was race day for two very nervous men .
the man in orange got on his bike , determined to beat the favored winner : the man in green .
the man in green was determined not to let his fans down and pushed hard to win .
the man in orange saw the man in green up ahead and pushed and pushed and pushed himself to reach his competitor .
sadly , in the end , though , he was never able to reach the man in green , and the man in green won the race while the man in orange came in second .
the competitors all walked to the competition early , carrying their bikes .
the red team began to warm up and did a practice run .
by the time the green team came along , the competition was in full force .
orange trailed closely behind .
ultimately , the green team pulled out ahead and won the race shortly ahead of orange .
me and my friend were getting ready for a big cycling race .
here i am , keeping my lead over everybody else . i practiced really hard for this event .
my friend gave me quite a challenge !
i was determined to keep my lead though .
my friend wound up passing me and winning ! i am happy he won , and will train harder for next year .
bike races usually involve staying on your bike the whole time .
but in this muddy contest , finishing quickly meant carrying the bike at times .
getting on and off the bike in the mud could also be a challenge .
it was n't easy .
the competition was intense .
the dirt terrain is always one of the most challenging parts of the race .
this racer was having a hard time guiding her bike out of the mud .
here 's another racer climbing back onto his bike after falling off .
only few racers prevailed in the mud terrain .
those who failed to prevail were disappointed .
[male] is riding in his bike race today .
[male] gets encouragement from his dad on looking him in the race .
[male] the gets his bike stuck in some mud so he has to get off his bike .
getting back on his bike he tries to peddle through the mud .
finally out of the mud henry finishes the race i first place .
now that the fall is here we finally get to see some cyclocross again !
at the race we marvel how riders just get up from spills like nothing happened .
they mount , dismount , jump an obstacle in one fluid motion .
sports are always more fun in the mud . cyclocross not excluded .
great finish for all the athletes who tried so hard .
one day while cycling at an event , something did not quite feel right .
i felt something pop in my leg and had to get off the bike .
i limped back to a medic .
my leg was in bad shape . i think i pulled a muscle .
after a year , i felt like i was ok to cycle again and started competing again .
it was time for the great bike race .
there were many racers there all wanting the same thing .
there were some parts that were tricky to ride through because of the mud .
it was a very close race down to the end .
i got 2nd place in the race .
my wife latonisha woke up early , excited for her race .
her best friend , dr. mcgillicuddy come over and joined her as they prepared for the race .
i wore my favorite outfit of a straw hat and some kind of straw hat and my favorite dress shirt .
while watching the race , i noticed my boss jiles running by . boy did he look silly !
after the race , latonisha was exhausted , but she managed to make it to the end of the 5k .
before we did the race for organization , we attended a store to pick up some toys .
i talked with my friend about how long the race was and if i would be able to finish it .
the man who organized the event was in organization form with a cool costume .
my friend dressed up as buzz lightyear and did well in the race .
my other friend went as woody and was one of the last people to finish .
this woman is very happy and excited . she is here for a race-day event with lots of extra fun .
she is so surprised to see her best friend at the same race-day event that she is at .
one of the races involves a costume race . this guy is the mc of the race to get everyone motivated and in a good mood .
oh no , it looks like her husband , woody , is in the lead . pretty good for a toy .
now that the race is over , it is time to sit down and contemplate how she did .
[female] mouse figurines dot the organization organization .

the bike ride began with the sun rising toward the sky 's peak .
occasionally , another biker would pass by .
it was nice to enjoy a rest break with a fellow rider .
the beautiful scenery was just another perk of the ride .
when the ride was complete , a cool beer was deserved as a reward !
i live up in the mountains . it 's a beautiful place !
i love riding my bike , even though i have to do a lot of up hill riding , which is hard work .
it can get really hot when the sun beats down on you .
i am happy when i get to my destination .
i get a cold drink and feel refreshed . all that biking is hard work .
got to the west coast this week in preparation for my big event .
we are getting some last minute training in . love the fresh air .
great photo ops too . hills may be tough for riding but can 's argue with the view .
also the serine coast line was amazing .
always end your days with a recovery beer though .
it was a beautiful , [female] day out . so we decided , as a family , to have a bike ride .
riding with the trees and shade over us was a pretty sight .
so was riding with the sky in all it 's beauty .
we made a pit stop at this small restaurant we 've heard about on the internet .
it 's called `` classic brewery burger '' . they 're suppose to have the best burgers in the entire state ! we shall see . it 's been a great day already .
among this beautiful scenery is a group of bikers enjoying a ride .
a small group of them got ahead of the others so they took their time waiting to catch up .
it was a sunny and bright day great for a bike ride .
they decided that they would all meet at nearby pub .

today was the annual bike race . it was one of my favorite events of the years .
the sky was so beautiful today . i loved it .
of course we had to stop and get some fuel to make sure we made it through the race .
everyone there had a blast and felt so proud of themselves .
i was even awarded ! it was a beautiful day .
[male] knew he had a big day ahead of him and was disappointed when he only had cookies and orange juice for breakfast .
at the start of his big day was a triathlon with his friends .
after the bike portion of the race , [male] had to run laps on foot . he knew that his breakfast did n't provide him with enough energy .
so during the foot race he plucked and ate rows of corn .
full from all the corn and tired from the triathlon , [male] did n't complete the race and instead fell asleep before it ended .
the food was ready .
bikers were waiting for the marathon to begin .
they stretched before the race .
corn was in a box .
they slept waiting for the bikers to return .

the snow bike race was about to begin
they were off riding fast and hard
some had trouble with the course
others had more trouble

all the while trying to fend of competitors .
good thing we practice so much and manage to stay up .
it was the day of the big race and a crowd had gathered .
[male] was excited this was his first race since he tore a muscle last summer .
[male] , the reigning champion , was not going to give up his throne easily .
around the last bend [male] was quickly gaining on [male] determined to win .
however , [male] was unable to finish the race .
the city wide bike race draws bikers from all over every year .
some take it very seriously with coordinated outfits .
they train all year for this moment .
by the end they usually have to dig deep to make it to the finish .
sometimes they simply have to stop and take a break , potentially costing them the win .
i was excited for the bike race and had been preparing for weeks .
at first i started out slow and the others pulled out in the lead .
but , i quickly caught up .
my rival was not happy when i won .
however , the celebration afterwards put everyone in a good mood again .
went went downtown to watch the biggest bike race of the year for our town .
before the race i checked out all the cool coins put in the concrete .

and decided to stop and take a look around .
once the race was finished we just abandoned our bikes and slept .
our family decided to participate in a bicycle fun run .
we had a little trailer for our son to ride behind one of the bikes .

my friend and i raced bikes in all different forms .
sometimes these bikes are self powered .
other times , we require a little help from some gas .
once in a while , we also require the use of a middle finger .
whatever the form of bike or communication , our activities help us to remain the best of friends .
before the bike race , we checked out all of the competition .
we were both nervous as the race started , but eager to get going .
during the race , we stayed close together , and even held hands at times .

[male] got the boat prepared to set sail on it 's maiden voyage .
he finally got the boat ready and set sail for the open seas .
[male] sailed all day long and enjoyed his new boat immensely .
i went to the dock last weekend .
there were a lot of boats there .
i bought one of them .
it was a sailboat .
i ca n't wait to use it .
this owner was trying to fix his boat .
there were many docks at the shore .
some boats were missing their rafts .
this boat still needed to get fixed .
this boat owner was finally able to fix up his senso boat .
back in the day when pirates ruled the sea , the senso was the most feared pirate ship .
they pirated many ships and always came out victorious .
no one dared to cross paths with them .
but the crew soon began to age .
after taking control of 5 ships they decided to call it quits . most of the crew are now actors .
the pier was beautiful today .
i took a trip out on my boat .
the other boats were a lot smaller than mine .
i thought the weather was a little too overcast .
my boat sat proudly in the water as i left .
it was a beautiful sunny day
jennifer wanted to go to the weird park outside of her house

today i 'm going to bike around the city .
here i go !
we stopped at this mural .
and also at this bridge .
tired after biking today .
i found an old bike in a junkyard .
the junkyard was large , full of many objects long discarded by society .
some of the objects were even unique and artistic .
one day , while riding my junkyard bike in the park ,
i met someone else who was also interested in old junk . now we 're dating .
we decided to go on a cycling adventure .
i put on my helmet and got on my bike .
we visited an old park .
we rode across the countryside along the river .
after the ride was over , we rested on a bench .
our bike looks a little old , but it gets us where we want to go .
here i am , riding to the local park .
i love this cool structure at the park . i always pose by it for a picture .
on the way back , my boyfriend and i passed the old stone bridge .
when we were done riding , we sat down to pose for a picture , sweaty and happy !
the men were participating in an off-road bike race .
the course was difficult and very rough .
the first person to make it to the finish line was number 36 .
number 8 was not too far behind in second place .
the course proved to be a tough challenge and left the bikers extremely muddy .
my friends and i decided to attend a dirt bike racing competition .

the race was fierce , but i ended up winning in the end .
some friends and i decided to participate in a bike race in the park .
my friend [male] is quite the biker , like a real racer !
i 'm not as good , but i 'm proud of my riding anyway .
[male] was the winner of the race !
however , he certainly got muddy , which we all laughed over .
this was no ordinary bike race it was in the woods .
it was treacherous and a lot of uphill and downhill angles .
the winner throws their hands up in victory .
although he did n't win the second place is still very excited .
looking at their legs you can tell this was a very hard race .
a patrol car rode ahead , making sure the road was cleared for the bicycle race .
the cyclists started off the day in a large pack .
throughout the day , fewer cyclists were spotted riding together as some pulled ahead .
police on motorcycles were set up to monitor the event and aid those who might need assistance .
the end of the race proved to be very intense .
the cycling event getting started .
police are in cars to ensure safety .
also on motorcycles .
some photographers do their best to get a good shot .
the race almost over .
racing takes many different forms , but my favorite is a bike race .
the competition is often quite fierce ,
but my teammates and i know how to deal with fierce competition .
the police are always on hand to make sure the race goes smoothly .
this is sometimes hard to do when you have unexpected roadblocks .

ever alert , the helpful police motorcyclist kept lookout for road traffic while awaiting the race leaders .
even the photographers got exciting shots from the cyclists racing around corners as they approached the finish inside the town .
it was a beautiful day to be otuside
they gang decided to go camping and bring their bikes
[male] was the first man out of the gate to test the trails
even though night fall came it did n't stop brian from riding his heart out
finally brian says he 's had enough and turns in for the day
when we went for the bike race , we got there early to find a good camping spot .
it was a good thing because the campsites filled up with participants fast .
the first day , i took a practice run around the course .
fortunately , the course signs were already up to tell me which ways to go .
the course took longer to complete than i expected and crossed the finish line after dark in the race .
my friends and i decided to go mountain biking for the weekend .
we pitched our tents rather quickly so we had more time to hit the trails .
i decided to take an easy route first .
the trails were long and rocky , which provided more than enough entertainment well into the night .
by the time the sun had fully gone down , my friends and i were gleefully tired .
we made it to the bike race .
we set our tents up before the race .
the race had started and there were many bikes there .
i was in first place for most of the race .
i came in 3rd place at the end , but it was well worth it .
the bikers camped out at the campground the night before the race .
they camped all around the lake .
one of the bikers towards the front is enjoying riding .
the signs around the trees lead them down the correct path .
the final biker makes his way to the finish line after dark .
she is checking everything on the bike to make sure it is working correctly .
at the starting gate everyone is getting ready for the race .
it is tough and there is a lot of competition .
here she comes zooming down the street .
at the finish line she completes a successful race .
i thought you had to wear sneakers when riding a bicycle for this race .
a shot of the first place racer .
someone else father behind tries to make up a few places .
biking downhill an be dangerous , but this cyclist is a pro .
the bikers can get up to some pretty high speeds when racing .
my bike is extremely agile .
one day , my friend and i decided to test the limitations of the frame .
to do this , we took our bikes out onto the open road .
with all the energy my muscles could muster , i tried to push the top speed of the bike , but it was too hard .
after a while , my managed to push his bike all the way to 30 mph .
there 's nothing i like much better than getting out there and taking a long bike ride .
it feels so good to be out on the open road .
i start going faster and faster , and feel like i am flying .
sometimes i barely notice the scenery , because i 'm in a zone where it 's like i am just one with the bike .
i pass people 's houses and barely even notice . it 's a great feeling .
this particular biker has special shoes and pedals on his bike .
there are tents set up on sidelines for re hydration and working on problems with bikes .
these two bikers speed past the tents .
they did n't need any assistance and they want to cross the line first .
the biker in oranges crosses the finish line .
the race about to start .
off they go !
everybody is trying hard to win .
winner !
he is very happy to have won .
i decided to head down to watch a big bike race that my friend was competing in .
the eventually winner of the competition went extremely fast around each turn .
my friend placed in the top three and got interviewed .
the winner of the race stood a bit higher after the race was finished .
the winner expressed extreme joy in winning and talked about how excited he was .
racing with the team is often difficult when trying to coordinate with a bunch of people .
on a day of the race , you have to make sure that you alone are prepared first .
if you can perform to the best of your ability , than the rest of the team will have a chance of doing well .
sometimes , however , even your best efforts are n't enough to get first place .
having a team means that you get to go through both positive and negative experiences together .
the starting line of the bike race was very , very crowded .
once we got going , it was still shoulder to shoulder .
after a while , i broke away from the crowd and got into the lead .
i realized at one special point that i was going to win this thing !
i ca n't tell you what a great feeling it was to be the winner and wear that medal !
all of the bicyclists in the race waited in anticipation to start .
after the sound of the start of the race , the bicyclists were neck in neck .
as the race progressed , the leaders moved ahead while the slower bicyclists fell behind .
the clear winner happily rode past the finish line with his hand in the air .
after the race , the winners were announced and awarded . the winner was very excited .
my brother raced in a bmx race last weekend .
he was fourth going into the first set of whoops .
after the first set of whoops , he had made his way to second .
nearly the whole field was behind him trying to catch up .
by the end of the race he was first , made podium and won some prizes .
the bmx action was exciting and high flying .
the whole family attended the event .
we watched as the skilled riders hanged in the air .
we enjoyed the athletic display by the riders .
it was a fun event to witness in person .
at the annual charity bike race , the contestants were getting ready to take off .
the contestants were prepared for a long race of hills and bumps along the track .
the crowd gathered around to cheer everyone on !
towards the finish line , the bike riders raced to see who would come in first .
at the end of the event everyone who placed received their trophies and had a great day !
the bike race is off ! let 's see who can get the win .
there is an earlier leader in [male] , he is pulling just a bit ahead over the first bump .
but everyone else is keeping up in good time !
and we 've got some great air over here , not that that counts for anything .
[male] wins ! look at him with his adoring fans .
with a shot , they were off to a great start .
some of them pulled ahead of the pack early on .
that was a great jump over the first hill .
a few of the racers are neck and neck . this race is getting exciting !
we have our winners ! they should all be proud of their hard work !
it was racing day , and we were all ready and excited .
at the mark , we paused . we were scared . `` ready ... set ... off ! ''
we biked as hard as we could , friends though we were , in that moment we were the strongest of foes .
eventually , it started to rain , but that did n't stop us . we were determined and ready .
i won , but i was n't a sore winner . immediately after getting crowned , i went and took a nice picture with my friends .
after a lot of difficult training it was finally time for the race to begin .
it took a while for the race to start which made for some tense and anxious feelings .
once it finally started , everyone pushed themselves to their limits .
once it was over , even those that did not take the top rankings were relieved that they made it through and happy for the ways they had challenged themselves .
the participants congratulated each other on a daunting task that not many have the courage to attempt .
on the day of the race , my bike team decided to wear our green jerseys .
we figured that we would be able to see each other better and the competitive crowd .
our game plan turned out to work .
since the other major team was wearing red jerseys , we stood out in the crowd .
because of our strategic thinking , we ended up taking first place .
the weather turned out to be great for race day !
all the participants were anxious to start .
the race begins and each one wants to finish first .
as they continue on the grow more tired but , also excited to near the end .
the race is over and the winner celebrates !
i entered an urban bus race with two friends recently .
we were pretty excited to be part of the race .
we stayed together during much of the race , so we could yell back and forth and encourage each other .
toward the end , we were pretty tired , but we kept going .
it was all worht it to be up there getting the flowers with my good buddies .
the girl was putting the finishing touches on her latest project .
she had worked hard for months and was almost finished on the race car .

she took one last look before stepping back .
it was time to take pictured of the car so she could enter the contest .
mom looked over the car to make sure everything looked good .
she did have a question about the steering wheel , so she decided to ask the best person she knew .
grandpa looked over and told mom , `` let 's ask [male] about this '' .
grandpa and mom talked with [male] about the steering issue . `` just center the steering wheel to the right a little '' , said [male] .
mom fixed the steering problem and it looks like we 'll be good for friday night 's race !
it 's always been my dream to have my own custom built mini racecar .
i went to one of the top specialists in the field of mini race car performance .
they had all kinds of fancy machinery to see how well my car was made .
they got down on the ground to really see what the problems were with my car .
in the end , the car was performing better than ever , and i was so happy with the service i got .
i took my son 's first drag racer into organization organization organization and [female] went right to work on the vehicle .
she set the wheels on rollers for easy movement .
i wandered around , checked out the equipment , and mindlessly watched her work .

i had fun at the bike show last week .
some models were trying to keep the sun off with umbrellas .
other ones just stood around looking pretty .
not long after i got there the first of many races began .
i was really rooting for my favorite driver on the # 2 bike .
all the motor bikes were lined up at the starting line .
a policeman rode around the track first .
then the official race began .
the trophy girls stood by watching .
a few had umbrella 's to avoid getting too much sun .

here is where it gets bad . parked my bike .
someone came by and threw mud all over the chain .
the bike had to be cleaned in order to work and that took hours . do n't park your bike in a dense area .
the amazing race got off to a muddy start .
she passed by this picturesque village .
but then hit a dead end and a warning sign .
this labyrinth was confusing but she held onto her wits .
once she found this map the race got a lot easier .
the great outdoors has such beautiful scenery . it 's very breathtaking to look at .
there are hidden paths and trails as far as the eye can see for hiking and bike riders .
many bike riders love to take these trails and hidden paths .
riding on so many trails and hidden paths a bike rider might make his bike a bit muddy .
sometimes grass can even get inside parts of the bike .
the young man traveled to this beautiful town .
he found a great area to go exploring .
he decided to rent a bike to explore the exciting area .

if you leave the village you will see a mountain with snow at the peak '
these pups were pulling a small bed along the mountaintop in my town .
here we are passing by the house in which i used to live . i love the stone that was used to make it .
this is an old staple of my town . it was a church in the 1700 's that was for all the people to worship .
there was a small festival held . everyone wore native clothing and looked silly .
our town can be quite beautiful , especially at winter time . just look at this sunset !
we arrived at the house and found a huge dog .
the house itself seemed a little spooky .
at night it looked even scarier .
the next day we got to see a winter celebration .
the first snowfall really was beautiful .
despite it 's small size , the town throws a large festival before the first snowfall .
people from all around the region come to the festival to enjoy the fun and games .
the first snow has fallen on the road .
as far as the eye can see from the hill top , snow has covered the region .
after the winter , the green trees appear again .

all the kids got dressed up in their festive clothes .
we 've had a lot of snow fall over the last week , but luckily it was n't pouring for the parade .

they did n't tell me this was a running thing either
we 're taking a taxi . we have disabilities , sorry ca n't walk never mind run !
ok i gave it a try and got run over by some crazy marathon enthusiasts
my friends and i decided to hang out this weekend and took pictures of ourselves .
we found a downtown area and just sat around for a while .
another friend found a bottle of high life that we passed around .
my two friends [male] and [male] sat and posed for the camera .
my other friend [male] enjoyed a swig of the cold beer as we sat outside .
[female] loved hanging out with her friends .
this group of people had been friends since elementary school .
they loved to drink beers and chat about times past .
being silly was common for this group of people .
having 40oz beers and reminiscing was how they relaxed on the weekends .
[female] can give the craziest looks some times !
hanging with the crew , i love them so much !
some days you just need a little to drink !
drinking with my friends can make for some crazy times !
still drinking , we are pretty crazy haha .
the two men partied very happily .
one of my friends brought his girlfriend along .
she drank a lot of glasses on her own .
i ate a lot of good food .
some of my friends took pictures at the event .
[male] and tilda decided to go to a party with their old friends .
they met them at the reception hall and took a picture to post on instagram .
the party turned out to be boring and filled with people they did n't know .
the meal was particularly gross and cold .
their only form of amusement was a toy , a toddler had left behind .
for her 21st birthday [female] decided she wanted to go to a wine tasting .
several of her friends agreed that this was a great idea and they tagged along .
no one felt particularly confident about pairing wine with food , except [female] , so it turned out to be a very educational event .
[female] 's favorite dish was dessert which she finished before even tasting the wine that went with it .
as a nice surprise at the end of the event they each received a party favor which contained various silly toys .
two friends pause for a quick photo together .
looks like everyone is having fun at the party .
some of the party favors were a bit silly .
the food was delicious , and mixed well with good company .
photos were flashing everywhere , as people wanted to capture these memories forever .
we went to a formal dinner for our grad school 's computer science program
i got to sit next to [female] who is an absolute genius and also a real practical joker .
she brought wind-up eyeballs to the table as they walked around our drinks and food .
the food was mostly mediocre but we were so hungry that we ate all of it .
the party was fun though and everyone snapped pictures to commemorate the good time we had .
we went snowboarding one day .
we where very excited to arrive .
there was n't a whole lot of snow though .
but it did n't stop us .
we had a great time .
the annual community sled race made winter an anticipated time for the community .
some sleds were very creative and dressed like bugs .
but any old tub would do as long as it would slide .
a few contestants took the opportunity to spread a message !
the important thing though was to bring the community together and have a slippery , good time .
these two men were very active today .
the camp had a very nice sign .
many gathered at that camp for fun .
several interesting concepts were introduced .
i had a very creative sleigh to ride .
we went to the park to celebrate [female] 's birthday .
we all gathered around while we watched people having fun .
[male] and [male] went down the slope in a strange sled .
[female] got to go through a happy birthday banner on a sled .
then i got to ride a horse down the slope .
the snow was fresh on the ground , so the only thing to do was have an event .
lots of people brought out a bunch of different things . this colorful caterpillar caught my eye .
down hill sled races where both fun to be apart of and to watch . only one person went to the hospital this year .
one of the sled racers had a birthday this day . they did not think through the idea of racing with a banner though .
this one guy even raced on a homemade reindeer sled . his fall was so epic , and we were all glad that he was alright .
the paint is ready for our tee shirt painting contest .
i select my paint colors to use on my tee shirt .

[female] was the proudest of her design .

we chose to create shirts
i decide to paint a bow on mine
after we finished we set the shirts to dry
our shirts came out very nice
what a blizzard we had ! it meant a lot of work , but fun first .
playing in the snow with you friends and family is the best after a big storm .
as we looked around us though , we saw we had a problem , the car was snowed in .
the deep snow made it hard to get around , even on foot .
after much work and a few cocoa breaks-the shoveling was finally done .
the neighbors worked together to clean up after the storm .
they dug out the cars .
it took a long time to clear the driveway .
mom and the kids stayed warm inside .
when the snow melted , it was bike-riding time .
the winter of 2014-15 was one to remember .
we got multiple major snowstorms , blocking us in and making travel difficult .
it took [male] all day just to shovel our driveway .
so the kids and i stayed in and pretended to have a picnic .
[male] is happy the snow is gone now , and he can spend his days learning to ride the bike he got for christmas .
our family decided to go out and play on this nice snowy day !
the kids were making snowballs for a snowball fight later .
the cars were completely buried in snow so there was no traveling for today !
the snowball fight is getting intense !
the roads were so frozen that you could almost skate on them .
the other day it snowed at my home .
snowed so much , the cars got blocked in the driveway .
i had to get out there and shovel it to be able to get to work .
while my wife and kids sat on the couch eating breakfast .
after i was finished my kid went out and rode his bike .
for their son 's birthday , the parents decided that they 'd take their son bowling .
he was very excited to try bowling since he had only seen the sport on tv
for a beginner he was great . only because the gutter was raised up .
when they got home , a yummy cake was waiting for him .
the birthday boy 's brother wanted to get in on the action and blow the candle , but opted not too , for the sake of argument
for our sons birthday we gathered up all of his friends and went to the bowling alley .
our two sons were very happy to be there and enjoyed the friends and food .
our youngest son struggled but still managed to get the ball down the lane .
we brought out the birthday cake and got ready to sing .
after bowling the kids went outside and started to play some video games .

catlyn on the other hand seemed to be holding her own across the table from me .
our designated driver maril was probably trying to figure out how we could be so crazy .

in the end , [male] gained respect by wearing a sombrero .
i spent all day knitting .
it took me a long time .
i made so many different designs .
i had a great time .
there were so many pieces that i sold .
[female] makes pockets .
the pockets go on garments .
they come in a variety of colors .
no two are alike .
she sells them in her online store .
my kindergarten class made felt images today .
i was really impressed with how they turned out .
[male] did a really good job with the boat . the backdrop of the felt makes it look like the boats floating on the ocean .
it was [female] 's birthday , so [male] made a birthday felt for her . it 's so cute i think i will let [female] take it home with her .
this is one of my favorites . it 's so simple , yet the design is very interesting , and the message is one everyone can appreciate .
i like to be creative and offer a new experience to baby blankets . like this boat blanket .
or may be i could design one for a special birthday occasion .
this one is one that i created for valentines day .
how about a quiet home where the family is nestled in their coziest spots
or a penguin that is ready to conquer the tallest glacier .
the class craft for the day was felt work .
the kids ' creativity never ceased to amaze teacher [female] .
first prize went to [male] , for his sail boat under the sun .
second prize went to [female] , for her birthday cake and gift .
and third place went to [female] , for her heart red clover .
[male] walked into the room thinking it was just a normal evening .
he was ambushed and forced to put on a humiliating shirt .
it was his 40th birthday and his friends really wanted to rub that in .
his youngest son even told him how old and gross he looked .
he was forced to entertain like a dancing monkey and held a grudge for many years .
happy 40th birthday old man !
we baked a special birthday cake for you .
now it 's time to open your presents .
here is your new transportation .
we added a sign so you would n't get lost . happy birthday !
the man who was celebrating had a great smile .
we gave him a black shirt so people knew he was the subjct .
we also gave him a name tag to identify himself .
he made my nephew feel very important .
we were very glad these he was a part of our family .
my father celebrated his birthday last night .
he had to wear a funny over the hill shirt .
my mom got him a walker for his birthday since he 's over the hill now .

me and my friends went to the park last weekend .
we were all very cold .
we had a great time together .
we took some of the plants from the park home .
it was a lot of fun .
today i decided that this giant vase would be the subject of our impromptu photography session .
i gathered a few of my closest friends to be silly because that 's what we do when we get together .
here , we are pretending to be trees and my bff is rubbing on my invisible boobs .

we walked home after a great day !
the owner takes his dog out to a local park .
after a short rest the canine is ready to begin it 's walk around the park .
the owner and the dog decide to move to a new area of the park
the owner and the dog jump across a ditch
they eventually find a good spot and watch the people fly their kites .
we took the dogs out for a tiny walk .
it was a nice , foggy spring day , but the dogs were really lethargic for some reason .
when they saw the sheep through the fence , though , they really perked up .
here 's rusky growling at them !
after that , we hit the park and threw the frisbee around a bit ; they loved that .
the park was filled with activity .
kites were flying from all over .
some people brought their dog to play with .
many celebrated in the field with their colorful kites .
some just walked around and enjoyed the day .
today was the festival of outdoor fun in my country .
this kite was the most complex one i had ever seen .
my dog scrap has a hard time keeping up on walks .
the park was filled with people having fun .
a walk with my lover is the perfect end to the festivities .
the man ventured out to spend a day soaking up some culture .
he sees the steps of the egyptian museum and decides to go in .
upon entry he is already impressed by the intricate design of the ceiling .
he enjoys watching the various ancient paintings .
then he finishes his tour with a look at the statues .
it was a cold day to visit the museum !
first we saw an outside piece on the way in which we thought was interesting .
inside there was a big egyptian exhibit including hieroglyphics .
there was some optical illusion artwork such as this piece .
near the end we viewed some sculptures including this one which was very cool .
the only barrier is yourself
museum trip on a monday !
the magnificent images on the vaulted ceilings were god like
hieroglyphics were mysterious and cryptic
the unchanging conformity of modern day glass manufacturing
the family went to the new museum in town .
as they walked up to the stairs , banners advertised some of the exhibits .
a world renowned painter painted the ceiling .
one of the exhibits was a newly found ancient egyptian drawing .
the museum had pre civil war glass bottles on display .
we had an interesting trip to the museum of art . the art starts outside with these illusions .
even the building itself is a work of art .
i wondered how difficult it was to paint these ceilings .
the museum even had ancient art .
i did n't realize how beautiful glass could be .
thehome and the whole neighborhood were covered with snow .
the lounge chair was iced over .
the car even had some snow on it .
but a bird could still use the feeder .
and a squirrel sat and ate a nut .
yesterday 's storm caused power outages to hundreds in the area .
people were stranded , stayed home and local businesses had to close .
residents were advised to go slow with snow removal to prevent injuries .
even local wildlife was affected .
local residents helped their furry friends find food .
while going out to shovel , i take a quick picture of my house .
the deck and chair is full of snow that i have to clean off .
my car is parked in its space safely shielded from snow covering it .
while cleaning the deck , i see a bird on the birdfeeder with some snow .
the squirrel is on the ledge eating away at its food .
it snowed all day yesterday for the first time .
we could not use the deck , there was snow everywhere .
the car stayed under the car porch . we need snow tires now !
glad that there are still seeds , and the birds are fed .
everyone is hungry and the squirrel is out eating too !
the first snow of the season has fallen .
the people are unable to leave their house due to dangerous road conditions .
shoveling by hand can be very hard work .
but , the beauty of the snow can be captivating .
the animals know winter has arrived .

even as i am older now i still have `` family '' night with my closest friends and family .
we like to have lively board games with drinks so we can play and giggle as if we were little once more .

we like to simplify and play `` go fish '' . either way we take time out to enjoy our life with one another .
i went to my friends house last week .
we played a lot of games there .
it was a lot of fun .
some people fell asleep on the couch .

what do you do when your grandfather and his granddaughter have birthdays on the same day ? dual parties .

the group was ready to taste the cake . we all had to wait our turns to get a slice of the cake .
others decided to wait until everyone got a slice first . they sat down and talked for a bit .
once the cake was done , almost everyone left to return to work . those that were still here chatted before cleaning up the mess .
because she was leaving on vacation , we decided to have [female] 's birthday party in the break room before she left .
she was really happy and surprised . so much so that she could n't stop smiling .
she insisted though that everyone got a piece of cake before her .
so after everyone else got their piece , she finally took hers and we all started talking .

we got happy when we were surprised with a rabbit , though !
all of us loved petting the bunny .
it was [male] 's birthday and we had hired a magaician for the occasion . being a good parent that i was i decided to be the first volunteer .
we did n't know it yet but there was something magical about to happen from underneath the cloth
much to everyone 's surprise he pulled out this white fluffy ball of love . i do n't think there was an unhappy face in the crowd .
of course he was a big hit and everyone had to pet the rabbit .
once everything was all done for the day i finally had time to relax , what better way than taking a nice hot bath .
a couple of friends decided to have a show and tell party .
the first friend brought an ancient persian rug to show everyone .

the next friend brought her pet rabbit to show everyone .
she passed the rabbit around , and it was the hit of the party !
the magician we hired for the party had no trouble finding volunteers .
here 's another baffled guest wondering how he performed a trick .
the magician put this woman 's purse in a box and made it disappear .
and voila ! her purse turned into an animal .
it was a cute , white rabbit and everyone got to pet it .
hiring a close up magician for a party is a great idea .
the one we got for [female] 's birthday party was awesome and he worked the crowd really well .
of course he had a special surprise for the birthday girl herself .
he did the classic `` rabbit out of my hat '' trick .
and the cool thing was , the rabbit was actually a real gift , since [female] had been wanting one for so long .

they invited a few more friends over to hang out .
everyone had a great time but did n't do any more studying .
after many beers , everyone was relaxed but not in the mood to study .
the night started with a group of friends in a simple discussion .
but after a few drinks , everybody started to loosen up .
funny faces , smooches , and hanging out the window was part of the fun .
then the markers came out , as did the groups ' collective dirty mind .
so much alcohol and fun , enough to drive a young man crazy !
i went to college to study , not to party .
i can be easily driven insane by my roommates , who do n't have the same attitude about studying .
they will sit around for hours talking about stupid stuff .
there is no topic inane enough to keep them from flapping their mouths .
here they all are , the wall of idiots . i will be so glad when i graduate .
[male] decided that he would study during the party .
this was driving [male] 's friends crazy .
while [male] was studying , his friends were enjoying talking to one another .

this man busted a move and showed the party there is no need to be shy . just get up and dance .
at the end of the party everybody was so tired they almost fell asleep on the floor .
we invited our new neighbors to our dinner party .
our coworkers were complaining about the boss . time for drinks .
alcohol got the party crazy . i barely know these two .
someone put on music while others wanted to play a game .
the night ended with a game of charades that had no rules .
in deep conversation with her friends .
everyone is here about to start the fun .
having fun with his girlfriend at the party .
flying like a bird and dancing after a few drinks .
they were all exhausted after a couple of hours .
when we sat down to eat the old guitarist was tuning up .
his partner tuned his upright bass .
the guitar player did of the talking , telling us a little about the duo and their music .
it was a good night for music at chalker 's pub and bistro .
when the old guitarist really started to jam . it was like he was transported , and he brought us along .
we were so excited to finally see this duo in person .
the cellist performed a unique solo of an old favorite .
the surprise cake arrived while the musicians took a break . perfect timing !
this is best jazz guitarist alive , in my opinion .
my favorite photo of the night looks even better in black and white .
the performers gave us an amazing introduction .
he focused on playing perfection the entire time .
he enjoyed the cake and leaned over to blow out the candles .
the music was well rehearsed .
his skills and ability will always be remembered . it 's a classic .
chalkers is a billiards bistro , not a pool hall . so some classy music is part of the mood for the place .
[male] plays the bass and it is not one of those electric ones .
during a break , [male] takes some light refreshment .
[male] has been performing for 50 years and tells the crowd .
the audience feels the emotion as [male] plays the first song he ever sang publicly .
the band was in top form tonight . [male] played the guitar near perfectly . hitting every note just right .
russ as well . making every note pop and shine .
[male] engaged with the crowd early and often . never a dull moment .
russ and [male] have played in a band together for over 30 years . they know their songs like the back of their hands .
whoever caught the duo last night at the show was lucky . they 're always a hot ticket in town .
on a trip to the location , i went to a lantern festival .
it was like walking through a magical door .
there were many colorful lanterns .
and many fancy lanterns .
and , of course , many people enjoying it all .
we had a lot of fun at the chinese parade .
we saw lots of awesome looking lanterns .
there were interesting looking buildings too .
my favorite part was this building .
as the day wound down , there were less things to look at .
we visited the annual lantern festival in location .
some of them had some controversial designs on them .
to us , we saw a nazi symbol but we latter learned that it meant harmony in location and was not a negative symbol .
the lanterns were all lined up in a row , waiting for the night . legend has it that they are suppose to lead the dead to the other side .
we waited for the sun to go down . afterwards , the lanterns were lit and the monks said prayers . it was a very solemn and beautiful sight .
we headed up to the temple for the festival .
no line , or crowd at the door , i think we were early .
theses lantern kites were very colorful .
these were more spiritual .
on the way out we noticed that even monks like ice cream .
it was a beautiful day in the chinese countryside
the house was decorated with chinese laterns ready for the holiday

our school recently put together a program with local soldiers .
before being deployed they got to stop by and get some goodies from us !
we knew they had their essentials , so we thought we would provide them with more frivolous items they would n't see otherwise .
we had candy , granola bars , lots of chocolate , the soldiers seemed to enjoy the options .
it may have been a small gesture , but these fine gentleman seemed genuinely pleased and i hope our school will continue this program in the years to come !

[male] carefully lined up each and every shot .
at times , it got boring waiting for him .
even with all of his concentration , i usually got the ball in the hole before he did .
overall the game was fun and i did enjoy my time with [male] , so the outing turned out to be a success .
we went mini golfing .
she thought she 'd kick my butt .
we argued .
we laughed .

by the time i was done bar hopping , i was exhausted and crashed .
the architecture on some of the buildings were a mixture of styles as if whoever built it could n't decide .

my day started out normal , a few tossed trash bins , trash , the usual .
some graffiti -- i 'll never understand the obsession some people have with organization organization in this town . it did n't take much to get that down .
now this was something special ! i saw this at the end of my run -- almost entirely unused and ready for the taking .
my ride home was n't any special , but i managed to find this just outside my porch . was this a sign ? was i being rewarded for my thrifty ways ?
talk about a huge mess !
everything looked like a landfill .
there was garbage everywhere .
and lots of stuff was broken .
there was even graffiti on the walls .
it is amazing the mess you make while trying to clean !
it looks like someone tried to enjoy some wine over here .
the litter on the floor will be a huge task to dispose off .
the condition of the over hang needs immediate attention .
it would seem that organization organization fans also admired this building .
we decided to buy this building for our business .
there was a lot of trash laying around outside .
there was also some painting on the outside walls .
we took time to clean it all up and give it a fresh coat of paint .
in the end it was worth it because it made the building look so much better .
our trip to the inner city was not very pretty

for this to be the last scene before the sun fully sets is magical .
these sun sets are amazing .
the view from here was the best i had ever seen .
there were lights off in the distance signifying something was there .
to me the sunset was more amazing than the lights off in the distance .
as i turned around i saw a large explosion way off in the distance . i never heard what it was .
when it was night time , we watched fireworks .
the colors exploded in the sky .

the helicopter landed in the middle of nowhere , dropping the explorers off .
the skies were a beautiful blue and seemed to go on for days .
the scenery was absolutely breathtaking .
although there was work to be done , it was hard to not pause and take in everything mother nature had to offer .
from the rugged terrain to beautiful bodies of water , this was certainly a majestic place to behold .
our group landed by helicopter to go on the hiking trail .
the trail wound around the hills through gorgeous scenery .
the view of the distant mountains was amazing from here .
the trail led us past this natural pool surrounded by rocks .
the lookout peak is where the trail ended .
we exit the helicopter and prepare for our walk in this remote area .
the trail we take goes for miles in this beautiful area .
we found this little lake in our walk .
this magnificent mountain huddles against the shore .
the setting of the sun offers us a glimpse of the beauty of our earth .
on my birthday my wife got me a private helicopter to look at the wilderness .
we started looking out into the mountains .
then went into them looking at a lake .
it was so beautiful seeing the mountains .
especially the wonderful sunset .
we had a once in a lifetime treat , landing by helicopter in a beautiful remote nature area .
there were trails through spectacular scenery .
we found an isolated beautiful little pond hidden among the rocks .
as it got close to sunset , we took some wonderful pictures .
the sunset was like little else we 've ever seen in our lives .
